Tony (1/4): Coming into this game, I already know I'm a huge threat. I created the spy shack. I found the special idol. I voted out my closest ally. And just when you think you seen it all, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Malcolm (1/3): In Survivor: Philippines and Survivor: Caramoan, I swung for the fences-- made some splashy firework-type moves. I have a reputation to uphold and I'm gonna keep making big moves. I'm so excited. I-I can't stop, like, bouncing in my seat. (laughs hysterically)
Sandra (1/3): I'm the only person to ever win Survivor two times… and it wasn't just luck. That's what I know how to do-- make it to Day 39 and not get voted off. The queen stays queen. Adiós.
Cirie (1/4): I am a bona fide ex-couch potato that saw this game and loved it. I'm the gangster with a smile like a-a wolf in sheep's clothing. I've made it to the end. What's the next step? The only next step for me is to win.
Debbie (1/1): Anybody who watched Survivor: Kaôh Rong would know that I've got a strength like a gymnast and a tenacity like a giant squid. When I come into this game, it's go for broke. This is the Kentucky Derby, The Preakness and the Belmont Stakes all at once… so you better go for it.
Brad (1/2): We've all changed the game, so to win this game, you gotta go big or go home.
Andrea (1/1): It's Survivor: Game Changers, so you can't just sit around and hope to get to the end. The stakes have been raised. This is going to be an epic season, so… game on.
Hali (1/1): Seeing the flag was like déjà vu. I mean, that's when you really feel like you're on Survivor. But everyone here is like a snake in the grass, and I'm like the cobra that you don't know is sitting underneath you, and then all of a sudden, it strikes and you don't know what hit you.
Michaela (1/4): This season, I believe, my best shot at winning is going to be literally schmoozing up to everybody here and making them feel awesome. Anytime somebody starts talking to me I'm going to go like this… (makes face) because I can't control my facial expressions. Like, it is very difficult for me to lie.
Malcolm (2/3): All of a sudden, that big bald maniac screams, "I'm going for the idol, baby!… (llama call)" If you're going to call a season Game Changers, I think it's more important for me to get a foothold with alliances and making relationships and not be pulling a "Tony" who's freaking out everyone at camp with all of this idol hunting.
Tony (2/4): I was like, "You know what? I'm just going to rattle them a little bit." And so I was thinking they were gonna all chase me, and if they would all chase me, I would stop and say, "Guys, I'm just kidding. I'm messing with you." But they weren't chasing me, so I said, "You know what? Let me take advantage and start looking for the idol, for sure," you know?
Sandra (2/3): Everyone is already talking about, you know, "We really can't trust Tony, look at what he's doing." But I don't know that we can hurry up and take Tony out, because we need him. He is a physical player. We need strength.
Caleb (1/1): I like Tony. He's got high spirits. Day 1, paranoia, stirring up trouble. All I can say is that's just Tony for ya. You wouldn't expect anything less, but he's got a big target on his back.
Zeke (1/1): I'm here to slay everyone and to win a million dollars, right? But I have, like, the greatest tribe ever. I got the goddess Cirie. I've got Ozzy. I've got JT I'm playing surrounded by Game Changers. Part of me has to keep slapping myself and being, like, "You're out here, too. You belong out here, and you need to act like it." So I want to get my hands dirty. I want to lather myself in-in the blood of my enemies, right? Like, I want to… I want to change the game. That's what I love about Survivor.
Sarah (1/1): I played Survivor: Cagayan, and I have a phenomenal social game. I'm a police officer, so I can read people, and with a season called Game Changers, I feel like somebody will get anxious and feel as though they need to make a move, which will put a target on their back, and then I'm going to be the silent assassin. (laughs)
Sierra (1/2): Finding the secret advantage is just giving me this opportunity to do something big, and it's exactly what I wanted to do with my game this time around.
Sierra (2/2): The Legacy Advantage opens up a lot of doors for me. I'm already a strong competitor. I know what it takes to do it socially. I mean, I'm a cowgirl. Like, my job is working with guys every day of my life. My comfort is hanging out with the guys, so I got to keep them close.
Brad (2/2): In Blood vs. Water, it-it was so difficult. I had my wife Monica on one side and I had my side, but I came on and was very aggressive. This time around, I'm trying to let everybody come to me. And I find myself saying, "W.W.M.D., What would Monica do?" And I promise you that she'd be slow playing this right now. I got a long way to go, but I think I'm off on the right foot.
Ozzy (1/1): I think my competition is fierce. In Survivor, big moves always require big risks. A lot of times they're not successful, but if you don't make them, your chances of winning the game are-are very small. Cirie and I played together on Fans vs. Favorites, and Cirie helped to get me out. I'm not sure if I can trust her. So this time around as a Game Changer, I need to be the master of blindsides, and if we lose an Immunity Challenge, it's gonna be Cirie that's gonna go.
Cirie (2/4): I think it's good to say you can put the past aside, but I knew it was a problem when I saw Ozzy on the same tribe as me. What the hell?! I didn't start the blindside for Ozzy-- I participated-- in Fans vs. Favorites, but that was, like, eight years ago or something. I mean, get over it.
Cirie (3/4): It felt like we were solid, so maybe everybody will remain calm.
Tai (1/1): I have a conversation with JT, Ozzy, he keep bringing, uh, Cirie up. He and Cirie have a history. He doesn't trust Cirie, but I like Cirie, so I don't want to get caught in something that suddenly they say Cirie have to go.
Cirie (4/4): So just hearing the way Ozzy is feeling about me, I know that it's going to take something more than just the conversations we had. Listen, the war is going to start anyway. What difference does it make if the war starts tonight or tomorrow? There will be blood either way.
Tony (3/4): We're all Game Changers here, so we know what the deal is. So when all these bums start talking, Tony is always working.
Tony (4/4): I went to dig a spy bunker next to the water well so I can just go under the ground where nobody is going to expect it, because they're going to be looking for spy shacks. They ain't going to be looking for an underground bunker. The best quality I have for this game is actually what's needed to win this game and that's adaptability. And if they get fooled again, that's shame on them. This game is not worth it if you lose. I would never do it if I didn't think I could win.
Troyzan (1/1): Tony is the biggest threat here. He's probably the number-one Game Changer, and look, I already caught him digging in places like the idol weasel. I mean, like, he's just… (smirks) he's out of control. And then he acted like, "Oh, hey, bro, what's up?" (laughs) I'm like, I didn't confront him, but he had like-- I can read-- and when he's guilty, he has a fantastic guilty face. But I got to be very careful with a guy like that.
Ciera (1/3): I played Survivor a few times with winners. I played with Tyson. I played with Tina. I played with Aras. And I think that I have that advantage where I kind of know, like, how to navigate that. Tony's played one time and he's won, so I know he's coming in extremely, like, arrogant and he's already pretty close with Caleb. And I am so excited to teach him a little lesson.
Malcolm (3/3): It's open season on who the first target for this tribe is. Everyone's playing nice with everybody, but names have started being thrown out: Caleb, Tony. These are two people I don't want to go at all, but what I do know is the person throwing these names out is Ciera. Strategically, for my game, I'm where I want to be. Everyone is talking to me, but if Ciera is the one who is going to push us out of zen mode on this tribe, it makes it easy to target her early.
Ciera (2/3): And I see that this is a puzzle that I had done before, and I actually lost the puzzle to my mom, and I totally let everybody down, and it's just-- it's a crappy feeling to lose the same puzzle two times. I'm nervous, you know, I don't want to be first vote out on the game-changing season.
Jeff (1/2): Losing the first Immunity Challenge is nothing new to me. That's exactly what's happened to me every time I've ever played. Nobody wants to be the first person voted out. To even have to go to the first Tribal is awful. And even though Tony is a snake, my gut's telling me to keep the tribe strong.
Jeff (2/2): When you talk about game changing, you talk about Ciera. She voted her mother out. That says a lot. Ciera has flip-flopped. She's forced ties. Ciera is slick.
Ciera (3/3): This season there's a little twist here. In the event of a tie, there will not be a revote, and we'll draw rocks right then and there. And for me it's a huge advantage, I feel like, because I play fearlessly, and I've been there. So I feel like I was just handed an advantage, but I know I didn't perform at that challenge, so the pressure is on for me because sometimes early on people want to keep the (air quotes) "tribe strong." Everybody majority wants to get rid of Michaela, and I'm fine with that. At this point, I'd be fine with anybody but myself.
Michaela (2/4): Going into Tribal Council tonight is an easy vote. The name Ciera came up. I'm perfectly fine with that. That's actually who I wanted to go home first.
Michaela (3/4): I ask, "Who does Ciera think everybody else is voting for? Who is she planning to vote for?" And that fool said me!
Michaela (4/4): I reacted in a way I shouldn't have, 'cause I'm trying to-- I'm not trying to let them see how big Michaela can be, but she can't contain greatness, so it came out. And, you know, it is what it is.
Aubry (1/1): Michaela is definitely a tricky one for us as a tribe. She has a bit of a hot streak, and if you ignite that the wrong way, the whole place is burning down.
Sandra (3/3): The plan was that Ciera is gonna go home, but the only issue is the minute that they told Michaela that it was gonna be Ciera but that we were going to tell Ciera it was Michaela, then it was a different story. Michaela was pouting, making these faces like she was pissed off. When push comes to shove, we could easily take out Ciera some other time. If Michaela is somebody that we need to take out, we need to take her out quick, fast, and in a hurry.
Tony (1/8): Last night's Tribal, it was the smoothest Tribal that I can remember. It was 9-1 unanimous. That's not how it works. Right now everybody's waiting for somebody to make the first move. I'm bored. I'm tired of just sitting back. I want to get into gear already. This is the part I specialize in. I gotta jump into action. It's time for me to make some moves.
Aubry (1/1): I talked to Tony this morning. He's a threat in the game. So am I. And I want to play with people who are threats, because I think that's the best thing for me right now.
Tony (2/8): All the threats that are around, I would like to keep them around because they're shielding me. So that's exactly what I'm doing here. Aubry is a big threat for being a strategic beast. Malcolm and Caleb, both huge threats, and Sandra is the biggest threat of any returning player, 'cause she won twice. You don't win twice by a fluke.
Sandra (1/6): I wanna work with Tony. You know, he's a winner. I'm a winner. Like, JT is a winner. We do have to protect each other for a little bit.
Sandra (2/6): Tony wants me in his alliance of five. My game is pretty simple: as long as it's not me, I don't care who goes home, which I really don't. I honestly believe that Tony is gonna help my game. As long as our interests line up, there's no end to the damage we can do together.
Debbie (1/3): Tai and chickens have a history that's sketchy. There's just going to come a point where those chickens start looking like angus cattle, you know? So we should not be getting too attached to them.
Tai (1/1): The chickens become my responsibility to keep them alive. I mean, nobody else would. I'm the chicken guy. It's like a burden, but it's… it's-it's a responsibility. I don't mind taking it on.
JT (1/1): Tai and myself, both of us love animals, no doubt about it. I mean, I'm a country boy from Alabama. But I'm looking out for me and myself, and Tai seems to be looking out for the chickens. I think the chickens inevitably are gonna hurt Tai. In this level of competition in this game, everything you do is critiqued. Anything can be a reason for someone to get rid of you. He's got to decide what he's here to do, win a million dollars or-or marry these chickens.
Tony (3/8): I came into this game calm and collected this time. Now I have so much energy bottled up inside of me. And it just burns me up just to sit down and just let everything be quiet, because in this game, anything can happen. People can change their minds. People could be lying to you. So I have to get some kind of intel. So I need to finish my spy bunker and get control of this game. You know, I'm here for a reason. I'm a Game Changer. I'm gonna be down there building my bunker and I have all night to do it because they're gonna be sleeping.
Tony (4/8): So I started covering myself up with debris to see how it works, but while I'm doing that, I see Sandra and Troyzan walking up my way. I had to bail out of it and I had to hide.
Tony (5/8): I creep up on them, they're talking-- very intense conversation. I'm hearing my name tossed out there. People are just trying to stir up things. They're trying to plot against me.
Tony (6/8): And Sandra decides to give me the biggest lie that never made sense. She said, "Oh, no, we're just talking about crates." So I'm starting to think that Sandra is against me. I wanted to stay with her, but the more I see her sneaking around doing things, I'm gonna have to take care of that, and I'm gonna have to put a stop to that.
Sandra (3/6): I thought I had aligned myself with Tony, but he's running around acting crazy. He wants to look me in the eyes like the fuzz, like the popo does, like they're taught to do. I don't want to ever deal with that again. There is no telling what this dude would do for a million dollars. Tony needs to go home.
Cirie (1/1): I know Ozzy is coming for me, and I see that Ozzy and JT seem super tight, which is not good for me. My whole life right now is hanging on, like, by a string in this game. I think they think Cirie, the legend-jedi-mind-trick-puppet-master, is trying to get me. That might be so… (laughs) it's just not right now. (laughs) So I have to try to weed out who I can play with and who I can't. I have to get in with somebody. I can't play by myself.
Sarah (1/1): I told Cirie I'm good with her, but if someone's going to throw her name out, I'm gonna go with it. Last time I played like a cop, look where it got me. This time I'm playing like a criminal, and we'll see where it gets me. My word is not my bond in this game this time.
Zeke (1/2): Cirie is a masterful player. She has this, like, mystical quality that, like, draws you in.
Zeke (2/2): I wanted nothing more than to work with Cirie, but as gaga as I am to be playing with her, Cirie is arguably the most dangerous player here, so my gut tells me that it's too early in the game to align with someone who everyone's gunning for.
Debbie (2/3): I don't fully trust Cirie because she's feeding me what she thinks is counterintelligence. "Hey, Debbie, I'm doing you a favor, pal. I'm coming to you, and I'm telling you they're trying to get you out." I assessed it, I don't buy it. I don't know if Cirie understand what kind of training I've been through. I am a captain in the Civil Air Patrol, although I don't get paid in dollars, I get paid in military training. So it's going to take a lot to outwit me. It's going to take a lot.
Debbie (3/3): All you really have at the end of the day, as far as who to trust, is your instinct, your internal radar, your (expletive censor) detector, and mine says Cirie would be on the chopping block if we lost, and she's looking for an opening. I admire it, but my B.S. detector was EH, EH, EH with what she was telling me.
Sandra (4/6): I'm done. Tony can't be trusted. I think he feels like he can just do whatever, but he's totally confused because this is my game. You know that saying where it says, "You're only the king until the queen arrives?" I'm here. I was born to play this game. It's so natural to me that I really don't feel like I have to put too much effort. I have to make sure that I'm still here. I'm still on top. I'm still the queen. Tony's going home and that's it.
Jeff (1/2): Sandra put together an alliance of five in just 15 minutes. I mean, that's scary. Sandra knows what she's doing. She's won this game twice for a reason. When two winners of Survivor go after each other for another million dollars, it gets ugly fast… and I love it. I can't wait to see the fireworks.
Tony (7/8): I wanted to work with Sandra, but now I don't like what's brewing. I can feel it. I can see it. She's scheming and scamming, and I'm going to have to put a stop to that. I don't mind snakes, but weasels? Not too fond of them. So, I think it's time for me to start getting ruthless.
Malcolm (1/2): You can't let Sandra get an army, mobilize her forces and have them at her beck and call whenever she wants them because that's how she won the game twice. As far as allies go, Tony's not my first choice, but he's somebody I think I can work with, not because I trust him, I don't trust him any further than I can throw his big, bald body, but it benefits me to have all the strong players there as long as possible. I need camouflage, and the more targets around, the better.
Caleb (1/4): With Sandra and Tony, I don't think you can't trust either one of 'em, but right now I feel like I can trust Tony more than I can trust Sandra, because he's got a big target on his back, and I feel the same way. So we got to try to keep each other safe.
Caleb (2/4): Playing with Tony is dangerous, but for challenges, we gotta keep the tribe strong. It might be a bloodbath later, but for now we gotta win.
Malcolm (2/2): I can't lose every damn challenge and expect to win Game Changers, so we need to keep the strong people who are good at challenges around as long as possible or else we're doomed.
Michaela (1/3): The challenge today was deplorable. It was so frustrating because I am a strong player. That's the only reason that I'm here. So to be standing there doing nothing while weaker players lose it again. It pissed me off. But the other people are making decisions for the group, so I guess I just gotta sit here and deal with it.
Sandra (5/6): At this point, I'm almost sure I have the numbers to vote out Tony. He feels like he can just do whatever. He's running around acting like he's the king, so he's gotta go. Unfortunately, Tony is good at finding idols, and that makes him dangerous, so we gotta split the votes.
Tony (8/8): Sandra is saying they're going to put Aubry's name down. To be honest, I'll do what I have to do to not get voted out, but if Aubry goes home, Sandra takes control of the game. So I know my back is up against the wall, but I'm not here to play it safe. I'm here to win, and to do that, I gotta make big moves. So Sandra's going home. I want the throne, and when I set my sights on a target, I'm a heat-seeking missile.
Caleb (3/4): Tony was right. Sandra's convinced everybody that Tony should go. And now, they're trying to get me to be part of it, but I don't want to do that, because when it comes to strong people, when you get rid of one, it exposes the others. You send Tony home, it's exposing me and Malcolm. But looking at numbers on who will vote out Sandra, we've only got four, so we need one more person.
Caleb (4/4): So Tony throws out let's try to flip Michaela and it might just work, because one thing about Michaela, she just hates to lose, so maybe she'll be down with getting rid of the weakest link.
Michaela (2/3): People that know me know that lose is not in my everyday vernacular. So to come out here and do it time and time again when it doesn't have to happen, it doesn't make sense.
Michaela (3/3): I know that Tony is a threat, but he can help us win challenges. But Sandra is useless in just about everything.
Jeff (2/2): I'm in heaven. Having two winners going at each other is Christmas. And the best part of it is we get to decide which one is going home.
Sandra (6/6): Tony has already been eating away at Caleb's brain. That's why he's gotta go. There is a chance it could go south and then I end up going home, but let me tell you something, just 'cause Tony won once doesn't make him a king. No one has a track record like me, and we're going to put that into perspective tonight when Tony goes home.
Sandra (1/2): I was leading the sheep to slaughter. So I am in a good spot with Mana, but now there's a swap and I hope I'm on the right side with the strongest people.
Jeff (1/3): With Game Changers, the game changes fast, but whatever I'm dealt with, I'm going to make the best of it. And it's an exciting time, I think. I love it. I'm ready to go.
Malcolm (1/4): You walk into this Nuku camp after spending six, seven days at Mana where we didn't get the chickens and we didn't get the toolkit off the boat, it's shocking. I couldn't pick my jaw up off of the floor, just… (opens mouth in astonishment) It's just the Survivor jackpot. It's like going to a resort. Everything's already built. They've got a bunch of food they didn't take with them. The chickens are walking around free like they run the place. They've got this awesome shelter and they decorated. That's how well it was going on this tribe. They've taken the time to hang ornaments from the damn trees like we're at some… dinner parlor in Mexico.
JT (1/8): I feel like the Survivor gods really let me down in this moment. Five to one is about as bad as I can hope for. I mean, in all likelihood I'm a sitting duck. So the only thing in this point that can save me would be the Hidden Immunity Idol. So I've got to do everything I can to stir things up here. In the back of my mind, I'd be already thinking, "If I can get them out there in the ocean, I can get back to camp and start looking for an idol."
JT (2/8): I get everyone on the raft, I drag 'em out to sea a good half mile, and, uh, we snorkel a little bit. Get 'em started fishing. And, uh, finally that opportunity presents itself when Malcolm bends the spear.
JT (3/8): So I say, "Hey, Malcolm, you know what? I'll go back and get the pliers. Y'all just enjoy this good time out here on the ocean. I'll be right back."
JT (4/8): I came to get the pliers. I know I gotta be back soon. Just figure I'll take every second I've got and look. Uh, idols could be anywhere. I'm looking in every nook, in every tree, every corner, every spot, every hole in a tree, up in the trees. It could be under rocks. It could be anywhere.
Jeff (2/3): We sat out there on that raft for a long time waiting on JT to come back. It's like, it doesn't take that long. What's he doing? I'm thinking to myself, "He's looking for an idol. What a great way to get rid of the five people that might take you down. Brilliant."
JT (5/8): I'm just frantically looking everywhere. It's never over til it's over. And I'm not giving up… everybody knows that. And they probably know I'm looking for an idol right now, but I took 'em as far out in the ocean as I could, and I left the pliers on purpose. So my job is to just keep looking. That's all I can do.
Jeff (3/3): If JT's out looking for an idol, good for JT It just doesn't matter. We have the majority, 5-1, so JT is screwed.
Brad (1/3): This is my new home, so I start thinking, "Let me make this house a home." I love antiquing and I like to decorate. Monica and I spend a lot of-- we decorated our own house. I kind of relax as I'm doing that. It kind of gives me something to think about. We're here, meager supplies, meager food, in an unbelievable game, difficult, but I'm having a lot of fun because it's 4-2, and I'm thinking, "I'm in good shape." The four of us Nuku are going to stay together, and it's going to come down to either Hali or Caleb.
Hali (1/2): We have to play it like we're one big happy family, but Caleb and I, we're at the bottom, numbers-wise. Caleb and Tai could get back together and put a big target on their back, and so all of a sudden, maybe I'm not the most obvious target.
Brad (2/3): Truthfully, I wouldn't mind getting rid of Caleb first. Caleb, Debbie and Tai played together on Survivor: Kaôh Rong and that's the threat. I'm trying to bring in Tai and Debbie closer to me than everybody else.
Caleb (1/2): Tai and I are back together again. It-- it's a great feeling because we just had-- have a really good, uh, close friendship, and I hope that we can continue what we had before.
Tai (1/2): The plan is to vote off Hali or Caleb, and I know I crossed a line, because I told Caleb, but I do want to play with Caleb. We have relationship before. We have pretty big relationship. But this is exactly what happened last time. I'm put in a position to betray my friends. If I protect my buddy, I have to betray Brad. So I'm weighing the risk. Either way, it's going to hurt.
Zeke (1/1): We get up to camp and there's nothing but fishing gear and a meager amount of rice, a pot and a machete. You know it's congenial. There's no more trying to be nice to Troyzan. I'm sure he feels like he's on the outs because, you know, for all intents and purposes he is.
Ozzy (1/2): We got to start from the beginning, and I've got to take the lead because I got like 115 days on Survivor, more or less. I am one of the veterans in this game. I have played this four times now, and this is a chance, you know, to let my tribe know that I still got the skills and that they can't get rid of me yet.
Cirie (1/1): I wasn't on the right side of the numbers in the old Nuku tribe, and I think Ozzy is still a little skittish of me, but I'm trying to cultivate a relationship with him, so I need to take advantage of this new start. I'm hoping that'll help me later on down the line.
Ozzy (2/2): On the original Nuku tribe, I didn't have a strong alliance with Cirie, but here we need each other, so this is a crucial time for me to build trust, and if we do, Troyzan can be an easy first one to go.
Andrea (1/1): Troyzan is a cool guy. He's super laid back, but the thing is this is Survivor and it's all a numbers game. I mean, we're… we're gonna get rid of him if we lose. So we have to try to make him feel comfortable.
Troyzan (1/4): Andrea, come on, man. She's-- she acts like she's my buddy, but she's a little devil, that one. She just-- I know she's playing a game. She's-- she's not as clever, I think, as she thinks she is. Come on, I'm 54 years old. I'm the oldest guy out here, and, you know, my intuition is-is good, and I feel like I learned so much from One World. And, you know, I found an idol then when I had to find one. You know, I won an immunity when I had to and changed the game. So this time I will not let any stone be unturned. I'm going to start to at least look for the idol.
Troyzan (2/4): So at the next Immunity Challenge, ugh… it's just going to be crazy for me. It's going to be hugely difficult because I have two things to think about, winning a super tough game-changing challenge, plus I also have to find the Hidden Immunity Idol in front of everybody. But if I can do it, it's like a complete 180.
JT (6/8): Sandra's-- she's mentioned a couple of times she'd love to have the goats. She's starving to death. "Man, we could eat so much goat." I said, "Yeah, that'd be great, you know? You know, I could probably catch one for you, you know?"
JT (7/8): I don't really want to catch and eat a goat, but first thing I need to do is keep myself safe, and if I can feed Sandra and make her happy, then, uh, I think Sandra will probably love me to death, and that will probably keep me safer in this game.
Malcolm (2/4): Catching a goat was never on my bucket list. And we pick it up and start heading back to camp and realize that the only reason we caught it was because it was a mama goat and it didn't want to run away with-- from its baby. So we don't really have a choice; we won't kill him because we have a conscience. But I have to be very careful what I say to Sandra, because Sandra desperately wants to eat the goat, and in a game like Survivor, there's no need to make enemies or cause angst in this camp.
Michaela (1/1): Sandra don't care about killing these goats. In her mind, it's just food. She was a villain for a reason.
Sandra (2/2): I don't see anything wrong with killing and eating a goat. That's what they're here for, for human consumption. Everyone wants to add their two cents in, and I got to get everybody to do it as a group because that was the plan… to catch it-- to catch something and kill it.
JT (8/8): I didn't really expect to catch a goat this quick, but I'm not a savage beast, and there's no way I'm going to kill that mama goat and her baby. I just can't do it. Sandra wants to eat a goat and she's running the show, but, you know, I'd rather let these goats go and let's see if we can catch another random goat that's not a mama or a baby. So I'm going to try my best to save the goat.
Malcolm (3/4): You can tell who is for it and who is against it, immediately. Sandra doesn't give a damn, which is just Sandra's M.O. about life, I've started to realize. But everybody else starts talking it through and no one wants to be the Survivor that abandoned a baby goat motherless to the wild.
Malcolm (4/4): This is an easy decision because we have a heart. We're not going to kill either of the goats. So we ended up letting the goats go. That initial surge of adrenaline and your mouth watering slows down a lot when you're actually thinking about abandoning a little baby goat. So it made sense, like, in our hearts to let it go, and it's going to be much better for this tribe moving forward.
Troyzan (3/4): This idol being hidden under this table makes me way nervous, because I'm in charge of untying knots. So I have to wait until after the challenge ends in order to nab it.
Troyzan (4/4): To find an idol again is like, "Oh, I did it!" And finding this changes everything. It's life for me. It gives you the feeling of power, and power is huge in this game.
Debbie (1/2): In this game it's all about numbers. This is a dictatorship, majority rules. So we will have a brief negotiation, whether it is Caleb or Hali, and I believe we're rock solid sticking together.
Hali (2/2): We lost the challenge. Like, the unthinkable occurred. So a miracle will happen if I'm to be here tomorrow. I'm feeling like two against four and Caleb's a freakin' powerhouse, so immediately I know I'm in hot water.
Caleb (2/2): I got my head kind of down because I just hate to lose, and today's the ninth day, which I left last time. I got life-flighted out on a helicopter and almost lost my life, so the only thing on my mind now is, you know, are they going to go strong with this tribe and keep me and give me another life in this game?
Sierra (1/1): The two names that are on the chopping block tonight are Hali and Caleb. I really haven't talked to Hali since I played with her before on Worlds Apart, so seeing her here, you know, we have no relationship, but Tai and Caleb, I mean, they scare me. They're close. There would have to be some underlying alliance there. I mean, come on. You know each other, so, yeah, there is a little bit of concern. But obviously if you target a strong player such as Caleb, your chances of winning challenges gets smaller and smaller.
Debbie (2/2): My logic is this: I got Caleb and Tai from Kaôh Rong that I could potentially work with, but Tai, Caleb have a history, and one thing I've learned from playing before is past relationships absolutely matter, and you're a fool to discount them.
Brad (3/3): Maybe getting rid of Hali would be a better choice. But Caleb, Debbie, and Tai absolutely have a relationship, and if they wanted to team up, I'm sure they would send me home first, but right now I don't want to be the chief, so I would like Tai to make the decision.
Tai (2/2): Brad give me such valuable advice. It makes sense. Last time I played with my heart, but this is Game Changers. I got to think clear. If we get rid of Caleb, it's very difficult, because I'm a friend of Caleb. We played together before. We had some great time, and it's very, very difficult for me to then say I would write his name down, because it's such a betrayal to our friendship. Can I do it? My heart says, "He's my friend. You're not going to be able to live with it. You will keep reliving this moment over and over again." So tonight I have to really think with my brain who is a better person to take out, Hali or Caleb?
Tai (1/2): I'm very close to Caleb, so this vote was really hard for me, but I want to earn my trust from the rest of my tribe. I'm not playing with my heart this time. I'm playing with my, uh-- my-my br-- my-my-my head.
Hali (1/2): Caleb going home last night instead of me was a break in this game. I know that Debbie and Tai do have a complicated relationship, so I'm trying to show Debbie that I am your asset going forward, and Tai is a liability.
Debbie (1/2): This is my second time playing, not my first, so I tell Hali just what I think she wants to hear, but the philosophy for this Mana tribe is to keep old Nuku tribe.
Debbie (2/2): It's too soon to make Tai a target, so Hali, you have no options. You have none.
Cirie (1/1): We thought we had it, but then Troyzan dropped the ball. He was terrible… (chuckles) He already was the odd man out, and now Troyzan's life is hanging on, like, by a string.
Ozzy (1/1): As a tribe, losing is always horrible. Like, we all want to win. But losing the Reward Challenge was great for me because without rewards they need me to survive in this game. You know, I feel really confident I've been doing an awesome job being the rock of this tribe. Not to toot my own horn, but I'm able to catch fish and able to provide a constant supply of great protein. If I didn't bring food in, my name would come up a lot more than it does. But more than that, it's almost like a meditation. Fishing gives me a chance to think about the game and come back a little more grounded. It's just extraordinary.
Andrea (1/1): Ozzy's played four times. He's no joke. As a fan of the show, just seeing him in action is amazing. You know, he caught this stingray, so we're going to get a meal, and hopefully, that's going to give us more confidence to do well in the next challenge.
Sandra (1/2): This tribe has got it going on, let me tell you. Best tribe evah! I'm ecstatic here at the Nuku tribe. I pretty much got everything in line. All my relationships with everyone are perfect. I'm the queen here; I know that much. I know I'm running the show, and nobody really knows it.
JT (1/2): The longer Sandra's in this game, the more trouble we're gonna have getting rid of her. She's a two-time winner for more than one reason. And you can tell by the attitude, the sass in Sandra's voice, she knows she's in charge. Malcolm and I definitely hit it off. We're both hard competitors, so Malcolm's excited. I can see it. Yeah, he wants to play with me. And I don't plan on losing, but if we lose an Immunity Challenge, bing bang boom, I can go ahead and make my move like I need to do here and get rid of Sandra.
Aubry (1/1): This twist is so dangerous to everyone because any fracture in any relationship is a reason to send somebody home tonight. This Tribal is going to be insane.
Malcolm (1/1): I'm starting to think I just need to be ready for everything in Survivor: Game Changers, 'cause who knows what Probst is cooking up next. Me and JT wanted to get rid of Sandra, but we do have a numbers advantage. We're up 6-5 on Mana. So if we stay together, it's very simple on paper, but on paper is the only place it's simple.
Sandra (2/2): It takes one person to flip to change everything, but we have to vote six strong. If someone messes this up, they're getting their ass beaten when they come back to this camp.
Jeff (1/1): We're not on the same page. Everybody is on their own page. This is Survivor, and everybody plays as part of a tribe, but it's an individual game from the beginning, regardless of what anybody says.
JT (2/2): The most trustworthy relationship I have on the Mana tribe is Brad Culpepper. If I was a betting man, Brad is over there now saying, "All our votes are going to Sandra." I could be a swing vote and vote Sandra, but that's a big risk. I could just simply go with majority and vote Sierra or Tai-- Hmmm… But, you know, I'd much rather see Sandra go. If I wanted to, I could definitely change… change the course of this game big time.
Brad (1/1): This Tribal is gonna be extremely complicated, 'cause now we're going with them having six against our five. I know that four of us are all gonna vote one way. We have one wild card, Hali, who used to be on death row. However, now the Survivor gods smiled on her and she's in a pretty enviable position.
Hali (2/2): Oh, my gosh. All of a sudden, oh, look, how the tables have turned. I mean, I have options. I could go with this tribe, but I could also flip. There's so many different dynamics going on that you need to consider your short-term and long-term game at the same time in this vote.
Tai (2/2): It is very tricky tonight, because we still don't know whether JT is with us or with them. If they got the number, why wouldn't they stick together? So I need to look for a Hidden Immunity Idol. My mind is like, "Idol, idol, idol. Where do I go?" If you have it, it's a lifeline. It's protection. I thought I had found the idol, but I found the clue. The clue tell me to come to a clearing near the tribe flag. There's the tree with two maker. Line up. Then another tree with three marker. Line up with the tribe flag, make a cross, that's where to dig. I need the idol and then I can change the game around. You never give up in Survivor until your torch is out. This idol gonna equal out the two tribe power. They have the number, we have the idol. (kisses idol) The best key to life. Key to a life.
Sierra (1/1): Right before Tribal, Tai has found an idol. I'm extremely excited, but I'm also completely terrified because we just don't know who to play it for. A lot can go wrong, but I'm just praying that we can make this happen 'cause it's going to be a huge move. Tonight's Tribal has never been done before. This is going to be crazy, because it can be anybody tonight.
JT (1/8): Tribal Council tonight went about as bad as it could have for me. I told Brad Sierra was in trouble and to play the idol if he had it. I thought it was an easy opportunity to get rid of Sandra. Unfortunately, they voted out our strongest player, Malcolm. Malcolm was my closest friend on this tribe, so I gotta smooth it over here at camp as best I can and, uh, move forward.
JT (2/8): They can't really prove what I said, so I'm going to defend myself 100%. Take it to my grave, because I'm here to win a million dollars.
Sandra (1/3): I'm pissed. JT's hands are all over this. This is JT's dirty deed. And if he knows how I am, I'm going to turn around and send his ass packing right behind Malcolm if I can. He crossed me. It's payback time.
JT (3/8): Tribal Council was really tough for me. My biggest fear right now is, you know, if we lose an Immunity Challenge, I should be the one to go. So I've got to get my hands on an idol. You know, as much as a I hate it, that's the truth.
JT (4/8): Lo and behold, I found a clue, and it says, "To find your safety requires intersecting landmarks around your beach. Search casually, or in desperation, your protection is in reach." That's great news. I've seen the trees with marks on 'em, so with everyone away from camp, a couple of minutes, I'll have it.
JT (5/8): Lo and behold, I found the idol and no one knows, which was perfect. That's what I need. I'll never tell a soul, and that idol will keep me in this game.
Debbie (1/5): Once again, we lost. And we don't strategize. It's a dictatorship with Brad just telling people what positions they're going to take. The bottom line is, I'm pissed.
Sarah (1/2): Tavua, who started literally from scratch, has somehow banded together, and we're just, like, dominating stuff now. But I don't want to be overconfident. In the event that something crazy happens, I need options.
Sarah (2/2): At this point, Troyzan's the odd one out against me and the other four, but the set four, that's stupid. That's boring. I don't like it. Let's grow up. Come on. I'm completely playing this game like a criminal this time. I know how criminals lie to me. So I know how to lie to these people.
Troyzan (1/1): I have an idol, and Sarah doesn't know anything about it, and she says she wants to work with me. So it would be a huge plus in my game not to play my idol right now. So if I could work with Sarah and keep my idol… I mean, that would be… (makes Ok gesture) the golden ticket.
Brad (1/1): Today at the challenge, Hali rocked the balance beam, but Debbie couldn't get over it, and we lost the peanut butter. And she was adamant that she could balance, but now she's real angry, so I don't know what she wants. The only predictability of Debbie is that she's unpredictable.
Debbie (2/5): Brad treats me with very little respect. Brad is used to being in charge, whether it's a football team, a law firm, his family-- Brad is in charge.
Debbie (3/5): If Hali wants to do the balance beam, even though she cost us peanut butter and jelly by (raises voice) dicking around for 10 freaking minutes and I zipped across the balance beam in 30 seconds, that means you don't respect me. It's freaking nauseating, frustrating, (screaming) and I'm pissed!
Hali (1/1): So Debbie's explosion about Brad centered on-on her not being heard in the challenges. I don't really see the argument. I think Brad is great in challenges. He's a leader. He pulls people together. But she thinks that I'm the princess, I get whatever I want, and she's the ghoul that gets nothing. (light chuckle)
Tai (1/4): I'm trying to comfort her, but watching Debbie get upset like that, I got really scared. I think Debbie's just different. She's like a crazy lady. Debbie thinks she's an expert in everything, but Hali is better than her, as far as agility in the challenge.
Debbie (4/5): I don't explode in anger. I take it out in my workout. It's why I look (flexes both arms) like this, and have (raises shirt to show abdomen) an eight-pack, because I don't get pissed. This is it. I'm venting. It'll be over. I'll make a strategic, calm decision, and it may be him. I'd rather die fighting than live on my knees. So it makes perfect sense for me to make "Mister Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Brad," my next target.
Debbie (5/5): Why not take out Brad next? He's a wanker. May the best man be left standing. Bring it on, Brad. Bring it on.
JT (6/8): Michaela's starting to kind of lose her bearings out here. She's a little out there already, unstable. Yesterday the challenge was a little bit hard for me to handle. You know, no one wants to babysit out here when we're trying to survive. And today she wants seven drips of coffee and a spoonful of sugar. That blows my mind.
Sandra (2/3): So JT was annoyed that Michaela was using one tablespoon of sugar for a tiny sip of coffee. So I had a sweet idea, and I said, "I'm just going to go ahead and eat the rest of the sugar." The only other person here that uses the sugar is JT and Michaela, so I knew JT would blame Michaela for the sugar jar being empty.
Jeff (1/2): The sugar disappeared… (laughs hysterically) JT thinks it's Michaela, and it's 100% Sandra.
Michaela (1/3): JT was trying to act like I took the sugar. I was just so angry. And the problem with me is the more I try to hold something in, the worse it gets. And in this environment, it's like you hold it in, hold it in, hold it in, but I wanted to kill him.
Tai (2/4): I can feel the tension in the Mana tribe. And now, I don't know where I'm fitting. I have to, like, look at, you know, what-- yeah, what's best for me? And I used the idol at Tribal. So, I'm thinking there's an idol out there. I want to be productive and go look for an idol. Even if they think I'm sneaking around, at least I feel like I'm in charge of my game. It's so hard to find. It's a big jungle out there.
Tai (3/4): Oh, my God, I found another clue.
Tai (4/4): I'm not going to look for the idol yet. I've been gone, maybe, a little bit too long. It's hard enough to find a clue. How am I going to find the board?
Michaela (2/3): The last time I played, the challenge that got me to the Tribal Council that sent me home ended with slingshots, and today it ended with slingshots. But this is Game Changers, and so the same thing can't really happen to me twice… I hope.
Aubry (1/1): So we lost the Immunity Challenge. The Fijian gods are not loving Nuka right now… Nuku… whatever it is… I don't even know the name of this tribe. Like, that's the point that we're at. And I feel like Michaela has to be the next person to go. And for JT, we came into his camp. He's done his job. He's been a part of us.
JT (7/8): I can't think of not one reason why anyone would want to keep Michaela in this game versus running with me.
JT (8/8): If I have to use my idol, I will, but they need me to win challenges. So, sad that this sugar's gonna be gone, but nothing's gonna be sweeter than watching Michaela walk home tonight and get her torch snuffed.
Sandra (3/3): Today's Immunity Challenge was for JT to win for himself, except JT didn't know how bad he had to win. I need to get vengeance for what happened to Malcolm. And I think that between Varner, Michaela, and I, we make a good team.
Michaela (3/3): Sandra, Varner, and me make three, which is enough to vote out JT Ugh… I'm ready for him to go home. He's just irritating. The only thing that might happen to go out of my favor is either Sandra or Jeff Varner deciding that they would rather vote for me than vote for JT
Jeff (2/2): Tonight, I am in a perfect spot because I can choose to vote with Sandra and Michaela, and vote out JT, or I can go with JT and Aubry, and vote out Michaela. And I'd like to go both ways at the same time, please. Anybody can have an idol in this game, but I want to keep winning. So it is get rid of an attitude problem or get rid of a big threat.
Aubry (1/2): I went into Tribal thinking Michaela was going to go home, and they voted out JT I'm constantly on the bottom, and I feel like I've been trying really hard to build relationships with those people, but then it all blows up in my face.
Aubry (2/2): Clearly, Sandra is running the show. And I feel like she's cutting my legs out from under me like a slow death. Without a doubt, Sandra is the best player here. She is the queen of this game, and I need to learn a thing or two from her.
Tai (1/6): I found a clue earlier. The clue say, "Go look for some board." I tore my brain, and I was thinking, in the waterfall is where the board would be. So I got to make a move. I gotta-- I gotta get this idol, but I need to make it quick before everybody wake up. The clue say, "Wet the board. When you find a board with tribe symbol, dig underneath that. The idol is there."
Tai (2/6): The last board I wet, there it comes. It's bright, white symbol of the anchor. That is so cool! I'm the luckiest guy. I found the idol, the second, within three day. Last time I played an idol, I changed the direction of the of the game. Malcolm went home. It shift the power. This one I don't see me using it for, uh, anytime soon. We'll see. I'm playing game now. I'm the Game Changer, and, um, I couldn't be any happier.
Jeff (1/4): I went from the top to the bottom in like a New York minute, and I don't know how that happened, but I'm going to charge in at head-first. I'm not scared of it, but I gotta get past P.T.S.D. first.
Troyzan (1/2): When Jeff said, "Drop the buffs," I was like, "Okay, this has gotta be some kind of good luck in my way." Being 5-1 on Tavua was tough, even though I've got an idol, I've just been sweating bullets all those days. So I thought anything that happens now could be good.
Brad (1/2): Jeff has thrown us some curveballs this season and this is another one. I end up on a tribe with most people I do not know. I got Sierra-- been with her the whole time. But while I was on the same tribe with Hali, we weren't really tight. And I never had a connection with Cirie. And I never met Aubry and Michaela. But we get Troyzan. Troyzan played with my wife Monica. I'm figuring that could potentially be a connection. He's also a man and I'm a man, and we're the only two men on the tribe.
Troyzan (2/2): Brad seems like a really up and up guy, but I also feel like we're connected because we're just two guys on a tribe with, you know, five women. This takes me right back to my season of One World, and the last thing I want to do is get bamboozled by women again.
Brad (2/2): I definitely think Troy is an ally for me going forward. I feel good with Sierra. I feel good with Troy, but that's only three, and I need a majority of four. So I've got some more work to do.
Jeff (2/4): Sandra and I are on the outs over here. We showed up here the minority because Andrea, Zeke, Sarah and Ozzy were all on Tavua together, and Tai was on the old Nuku with them. You can just see they're together.
Sandra (1/5): Me and Varner, we're in a bad spot. But when I come into a situation where I'm outnumbered, I'm just calm and collected, because once I get my feet wet, give me a day or two, and I'll be running the show over here, too. The queen stays queen.
Zeke (1/5): We have to get Sandra out of the game before we hit the merge. If you don't, she's gonna beat you. People always say you can get Sandra out of this game any time, but you know what's happened to everyone who's said that? They've lost a million dollars to Sandra Diaz-Twine.
Zeke (2/5): You're doing the impossible here. No one has ever gotten out Sandra, so it's gotta be very tough.
Andrea (1/1): Tai is the perfect decoy because Tai is dangerous in this game. He's really good at finding idols and he's really sneaky. He's all over the place and it makes me very nervous working with someone like that, so even though we're actually targeting Sandra, it would seem like it would make sense to get rid of Tai.
Zeke (3/5): We're in a precarious position. On the one hand, Tai is the name we're giving Sandra and Varner so that Sandra believes she's safe. However, if Tai was to find out that we threw his name out there, it could very well blow up in our faces, because Tai is known for flipping, so it's tricky.
Tai (3/6): In the past, I found idol, I flip-flopped. I was worried that they'd think I'm the dangerous one. They say the plan is to get Sandra out, but there's always a chance they might blindside me and get me out first, so I want to go look for another idol just in case I'm the target. I found an idol at Mana tribe, so I say, "Okay, at my new camp we have the same well. So the same clue, it might work here."
Tai (4/6): Holy cow! I know for sure it's an idol. I didn't even open it. Survivor god really looked after me this season. Having two idol tremendous power. Lots of flexibility. That's crazy. With two idol I am actually more paranoid. All the different layer, the complexity, the option. I'm really, really nervous. What do I do with it?!
Debbie (1/7): Today was a low point for me. Jeff tells me, "Debbie, you're going to Exile." I could not be in a worse position right now.
Debbie (2/7): Exile is not some hellhole where I have to freeze tonight and starve. It's a gorgeous yacht, and I got it made. I'm the luckiest girl in Survivor history.
Debbie (3/7): Nobody saw this one coming. Totally unexpected. Game changer in my favor. They're just never in their wildest imagination going to imagine that this is what's happening to me. Everybody is going to feel sorry for me because I toughed it out and I froze. Nobody is expecting that I go treated like the queen.
Debbie (4/7): On top of Exile being something so totally unexpected, here comes Cochran. I've met presidents, prime ministers, and I'm not very often awestruck, but to meet one of my favorite Survivor winners was an honor and a privilege. I literally could not stop laughing, smiling, freaking out.
Debbie (5/7): I am talking to a guy who has not only played twice, he took it to the end the second time. Cochran won. I could say anything to him and he truly had my back. It might just have been the biggest benefit of this whole experience.
Debbie (6/7): Just when I think things can't get any better, I get to pick from this box one of three advantages in the game.
Debbie (7/7): The extra vote is a certainty. It's like having one completely reliable person who I know is voting x way. You know, vote early, vote often!
Zeke (4/5): I will be the first one to admit, I like Jeff. I like him a lot. We have connected and bonded quite a bit, and even though we're gonna vote out Sandra and blindside him, I see Jeff Varner as a potentially desperate person who I think I could trust and save going forward in this game. But first, I need to convince him that Tai's going home.
Jeff (3/4): Zeke and I go lay on the beach, and within five minutes, me and Sandra, we're not on the bottom anymore. Zeke's scared of Tai because he can find an idol in his sleep, and you gotta get rid of that as soon as possible. I didn't think it would happen as easily as it did, and I'm not sure I trust it completely yet, but at this point, I have no choice.
Sandra (2/5): Varner is telling me they want to target Tai, and as long as it ain't me, I'll vote Tai out all day every day, but inside I'm thinking, "It's not adding up," 'cause it would be stupid of them not to get rid of me or Varner. We'll see what happens at the challenge, but if they think I'm not gonna take control of the situation, they don't know the queen.
Jeff (4/4): I hated that Immunity Challenge, hated every second of it. But I'm not going anywhere. Tai is going home tonight, unless Tai pulls out an idol, and I'm hoping that's not the case.
Zeke (5/5): The Immunity Challenge was a bit of a butt kicker. We got our, uh, tushies handed to us, and the only solace I can take is now we have an opportunity to get Sandra out of this game. She's the most dangerous player arguably in the history of Survivor, so she's gotta go. And as long as she and Varner think that Tai is going home, we should be fine.
Sandra (3/5): Of all three times I've played Survivor, I think this is the first time I feel like something could go wrong. Varner is telling me that Tai is going home, but I don't believe it. So I can't just hope for the best. I need to assess the situation and work my magic.
Sandra (4/5): I laid out the scenario of the Kaôh Rong Three. Aubry is still here, Debbie is still here, and Tai is still here. They could say that they're not best of friends, but at the end of the day, these people share something no one else shares, they played that one season together, and when you come out to play a game like this, you usually stick with what you know.
Sarah (1/1): The reason Sandra has won twice is because she doesn't come off as the most dangerous person in this game. I almost feel like the way Sandra talks to people is she's grooming us. She doesn't pressure you. Her voice never raises. It's calm. And she just starts to suck you in.
Tai (5/6): I'm getting really nervous. I feel like certain conversation I'm not included. I'm not very smart compared to all these danger people like Ozzy and Sandra. They're very good at scheming and plotting. It's not the way I think, so it make me nervous when they walk away.
Ozzy (1/1): Tai just spilled the beans and told Varner that we're all voting for Sandra. I was like, "What the hell is he doing?" It was stupid. It was unnecessary. It didn't make any sense.
Tai (6/6): Sandra won twice, so we have to take her down. But I do feel like I'm a little risky spot, but I can't get paranoid. I have two idol, so I should be safe.
Sandra (5/5): Coming into this game, I knew I'd have the biggest target on my back, and now Tai is saying they're coming after me. Tonight's Tribal Council is all about making sure that Tai is enemy number one. I'mma set him up big time, and I'mma going to twist it around, and he will go home.
Debbie (1/2): I may be the only person who's ever got to sit in and be privy to a Tribal Council like that without having jury duty. And now Sandra is gone, and I am back with Nuku, where I belong.
Debbie (2/2): So people asked me about Exile. Look, what happened on Exile, stays on Exile. And I have no intention of letting myself or Mr. Cochran down. Lips are sealed.
Tai (1/2): Middle of Tribal, all the conversation confused me. I say, "Oh, my God. You know, I might be at the bottom right now, and Ozzy is the only name that makes sense." Ozzy is a threat. He will win all the individual immunity. So I say it outloud 'cause I think I need to go there. I'm terrible at Tribal and that worried me a little bit.
Tai (2/2): So, in case my name is out there, I still have my two idols, but I'm nervous. Somehow this thing… grow-- have its own life.
Jeff (1/7): I got blindsided big time. Those bitches, every damn one of 'em, I just want to… I want to just punch them all in the throat bone, every one of 'em. I'm mad, but I can't show it. I can't let 'em know that I'm mad because I need them.
Jeff (2/7): I went to work immediately. Why not? I mean, why wait? And I had a great conversation with Zeke, and Zeke just poured everything out to me.
Jeff (3/7): Zeke and I have bonded, and I think he genuinely feels bad about what he did to me tonight. So I'm-I'm not not done just yet.
Cirie (1/1): The pizza would have made a world of difference. I mean, I'm from Jersey, I'm as tough as they come, but certain things you break down. It's been 17 days and you-- it's rough. It's taxing on you physically, emotionally. So we don't know what to do.
Sierra (1/1): When we lost ten whole pizzas, I tried to hold my head high, but I am exhausted. I haven't ate for three days. I can't sleep at night. I feel like I've lost a crap-ton of weight. I mean, it is a 100% real right now.
Aubry (1/2): When you get to a certain point on Survivor, your mind goes to places you don't think it's gonna go, and when you get home, it's really, really hard to explain what you've been through.
Brad (1/2): When Monica and I played Blood/Water, she got all the way to Day 39, and I don't know that I truly appreciated it until I, you know, been here 17 days. For her to do what she did, she's a tough cookie and kind of been a guide for me. I guess (points to Monica tattoo on right forearm) she's been my-my strength and my compass right on my arm.
Aubry (2/2): I am consistently amazed at Brad Culpepper and his ability to open up. Like, Brad is to me the most genuine person that I've met out here. And it's the first time I feel like I think I have a person working with me.
Brad (2/2): Cirie and Aubry both came up to me and just said it was so special you said that because they saw the real me and… surprisingly, made us feel closer and really galvanized my relationship between those two. Troyzan, Sierra, and myself have already got a good connection. So I think it solidifies the five people that I have on this side as far as whom I want to go with.
Ozzy (1/1): We dominated the Reward Challenge. It was… epic. At this stage of the game, it's very important for the tribe morale to win something like that because the game is just starting to wear on people and that extra boost is the most important thing right now.
Jeff (4/7): It felt so good to finally jump up and down and say, "We won," but I'm on the bottom when you look at it. So to win something like that doesn't mean a damn thing. I am thinking to myself, "If I want to save my own butt out here, I've got to find the way to throw the shade on somebody else." And Ozzy is well rounded, he'll win this game. Ozzy is very strong. You let him loose in a-- individual Immunity Challenges, he'll win every single one of 'em, so now's the time to get rid of Ozzy. Now is the time.
Sarah (1/3): Today, after the reward, Varner starts saying, "I really want to work with you guys." And I think we can pull Varner and actually use him as a number. And I really, truly feel like we have made that connection.
Sarah (2/3): Then he says, "Could Ozzy potentially be the vote?" So that's what I'm thinking of right now. I need to be careful because that's a huge move, but I'm ready to prove why I am a Game Changer. We're close to a merge, and we need to take out who is the biggest threat. It might be time to cut Ozzy's throat.
Jeff (5/7): I know I'm probably in trouble. I'm on my own. I have to make everybody vote for Ozzy. And I'll be doing everything I can to guarantee I'm not the one going home.
Zeke (1/1): I want to save Jeff Varner-- I think it's very important-- but I don't want to lose Ozzy because the way that I've set it up is to have bigger threats out there than myself. So we're in a precarious position.
Jeff (6/7): Zeke has been my partner and I thought I could pitch, "Let's get rid of Ozzy," but when I threw that out there, Zeke shut me down which was very telling to me 'cause Zeke does not want to get rid of Ozzy. A little light bulb went off, "Ozzy and Zeke may be working together." I wonder if the girls know that?
Jeff (7/7): Zeke is working both sides, and I let Sarah know that, and it pissed her off. If I'm going home tonight, I'mma cut 'em all off at the knees. I feel like I know something about Zeke that nobody else has picked up on. It's insignificant to this game. It means nothing, but this is not the guy you think he is. There's something else here. If I have to go to Tribal tonight and raise mortal hell, I'm gonna do it. I'm not going quietly off this island.
Sarah (3/3): Zeke sat him down and said, "The girls are gonna lie to you just to make you feel good." And I'm like, "What?! Why would you throw us under the bus so you could save face?" Things are starting to look weird now. Zeke doesn't really want to get rid of Ozzy and Zeke threw Andrea and I under the bus. I'm like, "This kind of is starting to stink. Do Zeke and Ozzy have something more going on that I don't know about?" And that really scares me. This could be a huge mistake, but maybe we need to get rid of Ozzy and keep Varner.
Sarah (1/1): You know, I come from a very conservative background. I don’t know any transgender people until now, and the fact that I’ve been with Zeke and gotten to know him as a person from Day 1… I love that guy, and it doesn’t change who he is to me. If anything, it makes us stronger, I feel. So I woke up this morning, and Zeke is Zeke.
Zeke (1/4): One of the reasons I didn’t tell people is I sort of wanted people to see me as myself. Often in my life, when I tell people I’m trans, that’s sort of what they’re interested in, and everything else about me sort of gets pushed to the wayside, but, you know, Survivor, it makes you tough, it makes you resilient, and it makes you adaptable. And I think I had all those qualities before, but they’ve certainly been strengthened and grown. And I think I was able to be a… a little more brave and a little bolder to help others and also to get over my own fears and to get over my own, you know, issues and complexes and insecurities of being transgender. You know, I really, really like the people I am playing with, and it is heartening, in this game, that often your lowest moments, you know, when something bad does happen to you, that people who are out to get you in some regard, do stand in your defense and do come to your defense. And I was truly touched, but in the meantime, there’s-there’s still a task at hand. A task that I’m rather committed to. I’m here to win a million dollars. I’m here to play Survivor. So let’s just get back to it.
Cirie (1/9): We walk into the challenge, and there’s a buffet on the table. So I’m like, “Oh, wow, it is a merge feast,” you know? So you’re happy. But at the same time, there’s Jeff next to a table, covered. So it’s like, “Uh-oh, something ain’t right.”
Zeke (2/4): Here’s the deal with Brad Culpepper, because I don’t think he liked the way he came out looking in the first Blood vs. Water, so Brad falls on his sword to be, like, the hero and the great provider. I think this is very much part of, like, the “Culpepper brand,” to sacrifice themselves for others.
Cirie (2/9): Brad and Tai got brownie points, because… you provided for everybody, in a sense. But that makes me suspicious, because everything in this game is calculated.
Sierra (1/7): I made the merge. I have food. I feel like a whole new woman. And now I’m going to go in guns blazing, and I’m ready to make some moves. And I also have my Legacy Advantage, but I can only use it when there’s thirteen or six people left in the game. Right now, we are at thirteen, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to keep it in my back pocket until the final six.
Cirie (3/9): Once the merge happens, everything takes off like a jet plane. Yeah, we all happy and we’re eating and drinking and last suppering together, but people are having conversations, people are reuniting, everybody is sizing people up, and things are gonna start flying. People’s heads are gonna start rolling. So this is where I step my game up.
Brad (1/3): In football, you’re only as good as your next game. I made the merge. Awesome. It’s in my rearview mirror. I’m looking straight ahead. Who’s the next person gonna be? It’s not gonna be me. Tai and I connected prior to today on numerous occasions. I think I’ve kinda taken over his Caleb role from last season. So I think I can trust Tai going forward. And on my old tribe, Michaela and Hali were on the bottom, so I want to gun for them first.
Tai (1/1): I love Brad. He and I have a lot of things in common. So I think he has my back. I have a number. I’m comfortable. I’m happy.
Hali (1/3): Little Debbie got loose. She was shaking it all over the place. I think alcohol was an excuse for Debbie to go “Debbie” on us.
Debbie (1/3): I’m okay that other people think I’m drinking, but I never had a sip of alcohol.
Debbie (2/3): If I have to pretend to be drunk and do a bad twerking and a shaking of my booty to crack these people up and feel very comfortable with me, then I’ll do it. At this point, thirteen is still a large number in this game, and you don’t know where their alliances are, so relationships absolutely matter, because if you think our camp is not going to be full-blown pandemonium, you’re a fool.
Debbie (3/3): I swallowed my pride and I did apologize to Brad, because on Exile, Cochran said, “Extend the olive branch all the way around.” We kissed and made up. I wanted to make sure that me and Brad were as solid as we could be in a game of deception and intrigue.
Aubry (1/1): I was so proud of Zeke, it’s amazing. More respect for Zeke in telling his story than I do for a handful of these jokers in knowing them for 20 days. And I think Zeke is right, the experience of going on Survivor, it makes you tough. And nothing is gonna be easy about the merge. There are thirteen people at this camp, and now the game at hand is figure out where people stand and who’s in the loop and who’s out of it.
Brad (2/3): My number one goal is reconnecting and strengthening the bonds that I had with people that I’ve-- haven’t been with, people that I maybe had a little rocky time with. Bonded with Tai. Debbie, she’s come back and apologized. And with Sierra and myself and Troyzan, so far so good.
Brad (3/3): You know, if I’m just thinking about myself and who I can play best with, I don’t feel that good about Michaela. Her reputation precedes her a little bit, and in the long term, I don’t really trust her. So right now I’m getting everyone together to get on the same page, and Michaela would be the first gobble up after the merge.
Sierra (2/7): So me and Brad don’t care to work with Michaela. I think she’s a little shifty. She’s tough to be around. She’s a loose cannon. She’s a beast in challenges. There’s many threats that Michaela has that keeping her in the game will hurt a lot of us.
Sierra (3/7): Every time I talk to somebody, here comes Michaela, creeping around a bush. She will not let anybody talk. She’s also very blunt and doesn’t have a lot of tact.
Sierra (4/7): Yeah, I’m constantly on edge with Michaela around. This has to be a blindside. She can’t know that her name is getting tossed around. And if one thing sets Michaela off, then we’re all going down.
Zeke (3/4): Michaela could be a potential number for us to work with going forward. So this vote is a bigger deal than anyone is letting on. There have been two sort of natural groups, fighting to get in a power position moving forward. It’s Cirie, Sarah, Andrea and myself. Then there’s Brad and Sierra’s group. And I think everyone is wondering, is the other side going to strike first, and I’m going to be caught with my pants down. And we have to strike first. These are the last moments of people pretending to get along. It’s the smiles before the bloodbath.
Hali (2/3): Going into a merge, it’s just like… (simulates explosion) people are everywhere. There’s pockets of conversation everywhere and you can’t keep track of-- of who is all talking. There’s not a lot of people that I feel like are working with me at this point in the game. Seems like Michaela is on the chopping block, but I want to work with Michaela. I think that she’s a great person, but she’s also a good number for me right now. So I just need to kind of lit a fire under Michaela’s butt to start getting some strategy on that’s going to help me.
Michaela (1/3): You can become a target very quickly here. Like I’ve already heard my name, and I haven’t done anything. And that really kind of pissed me off. Ooh, I was about to explode. Being out of the loop at this point in the game is very dangerous. I’m going to have to find some people that I can trust so I’m not the one going home, and maybe that person is Cirie.
Cirie (4/9): Michaela wears her heart on her sleeve. I used to be like that. I was-- I literally, when I was Michaela’s age, I was a hothead like Michaela. I thought I knew… (laughs) I thought I knew everything, but I learned when you put that guard up, you push people away, and in a game like Survivor, you want to bring as many people in as possible. You don’t want to be pushing people away or making people feel uncomfortable.
Michaela (2/3): Cirie and I had a real, like, straight up heart-to-heart conversation, ‘cause we do have a lot of similarities. And Cirie has skyrocketed in trust with me, and I’m extremely excited to play with her.
Cirie (5/9): Right now, Michaela’s public enemy number one, but I genuinely like Michaela, and as a human, and as a older… person to a younger person, you want to save her, and I if I can do that, that’s one person that I can count on to have my back.
Andrea (1/1): Tonight’s vote seems so simple. However, this is Survivor: Game Changers. No vote’s easy. Everyone has ulterior motives. So tonight’s Tribal Council is about who’s gonna take control of this game.
Sierra (5/7): As of now, I feel like I’m the person who’s in charge. I love having control. And from what I see, my perspective, there’s the big group and then we have our outsiders who are Hali and Michaela. I think Michaela going home tonight is what’s best, but I’m really worried about an idol getting played.
Sierra (6/7): Seeing Hali play this time versus the time I played with her before, she’s playing completely different, and that triggers something that she might-- she might have an idol.
Sierra (7/7): Right now the numbers are so big, I want to just split it between those two in case there is an idol.
Hali (3/3): Everyone’s just saying Zeke, so I’m going to put Zeke’s name down because what else do I have right now? But I’m not comfortable.
Cirie (6/9): I don’t particularly like to vote for Michaela. Is that good for my game? Why would I just go with that plan? Because Sierra says so? Being that there were two options, Michaela or Hali, why not Hali?
Zeke (4/4): Tonight’s vote is the opening shot in a war between two alliances, and I think everyone sees Michaela and Hali as potential soldiers in their armies. So this vote is making sure the other side is one man down.
Cirie (7/9): Here’s the thing, you can’t win the war unless you have a sufficient army. And if Michaela goes home, that’s one less person that I can count on.
Michaela (3/3): My name’s on the chopping block, but I don’t want to explode at all, ‘cause that’s not gonna help me in this situation. I’m super thankful to have Cirie here. My life is completely in Cirie’s hands, and I trust it there. That’s why I like to play with people I trust.
Cirie (8/9): Everybody is on edge. Everybody is watching everybody. So I need Michaela to vote for Zeke to stick with the plan, so nobody knows Cirie is the one that changed the plan.
Cirie (9/9): For me, tonight’s Tribal Council is about saving a person that I can depend on and use for the numbers on our side. And if I pull this off, the future of my game is looking good.
Michaela (1/2): Cirie stuck her neck all the way out for me in Tribal Council, and I’ll do the same for her if I’m put in a position where I can.
Michaela (2/2): For somebody of my background, a black American female, to be able to play with another black American female, there’s a level of trust that’s there automatically, so I’m deferring to her right now, ‘cause she understands the dynamics of what’s going on more than me, and last thing I want to do is mess up her game when she tried to help mine.
Cirie (1/4): At Tribal, I voted for Michaela, and Michaela voted for Zeke to go, which was along with the plan, but I have my own ideas in my own game that I want to play, so this next Tribal Council is going to let the dragon loose. Is-- everything going to be out in the open and the war is gonna start.
Cirie (2/4): The way I see Sierra and Brad, Sierra is like the godfather, and she is controlling Brad, who is controlling Troyzan. So it’s like a chain, and if we cut the top link off the chain, it’s just going to shatter. So I think she could be potentially on the chopping block. Zeke is willing. Andrea is down. I trust officer Sarah, and I know Michaela will go along with it. We’re ready for war. (laughs) We are soldiered up.
Aubry (1/1): I feel, right now, like I am in the middle of a big Italian family brawl. There are two sides, and Cirie, she’s like my black Italian grandma or aunt-- she’s more like an aunt. And if I’m going to be on Team Cirie, that’s fine with me.
Andrea (1/3): I’m dying to get out Brad or Sierra. I’m starting to gather numbers to slowly take over this game, which would be ideal.
Zeke (1/6): Typically I’m in control, but I haven’t seen a clear picture so far, because most of my information has been told to me from Cirie and from Andrea. They’re in control. Something is not right. I’m not in the position I want to be in the game.
Zeke (2/6): The last time I played, I might have shot for the moon too early. But if you’re going to live with regret, do you live with the regret of making a move too early or the regret of not getting a chance to make a move at all? You gotta regret making a move. You-you… that’s just what-- you gotta play.
Zeke (3/6): To be honest, Brad and Sierra, they’re sort of a threat, but they’re not really a threat. But I look at Cirie and Andrea as much bigger strategic threats than Sierra. They are trying to control the game. So I could get out Cirie or Andrea in this vote right now. Why wait?
Sarah (1/2): We lost the Marshalls spa day, and it’s a huge letdown, but I’m finding myself in the middle. I have options. And it’s just going to be which group wants to vote out the person that I want to vote out. That’s where I’m going to go.
Cirie (3/4): We come back to camp after we lose the Marshalls Reward Challenge. It was up to Sierra and I to win it, and we just could not do it today. You feel like a loser. Like, just… “Can I-- am I going to do anything? Or am I going to be successful at anything?” I had kids young, so I worked really hard to provide. I never wanted to be in a position that my kids needed something and I’m unable to do it for them. But this game, it takes you to the deepest, like, most hurtful places that you’ve ever felt, especially in a loss like today. To not be able to get it for them is like not being able to provide for your family.
Cirie (4/4): My family is my motivation, and I plan on winning for them. And I guess that’s where it-it gets emotional for me.
Ozzy (1/2): Marshalls put together an amazing spa experience for us. And this is the biggest reward we’ve had yet. There is really beautiful towels, amazing chaise lounges and coconut-scented shampoo and conditioner.
Andrea (2/3): We walked into the Marshalls spa and the first thing I noticed is the smell. We’re so deprived out here from a lot of smells. We all smell like campfire and sweat. So smelling the nice perfumes, that alone is a reward in and of itself.
Tai (1/1): I don’t know, it just feel right. I promised myself I would have fun, and it’s a fun moment.
Zeke (4/6): Rewards are great, and I’m having a great time. It’s like, all of a sudden, I’m not in Survivor anymore. But when you remove yourself from the game, sometimes you can get lost in that. You know, this is Game Changers, and your mind needs to be running, and if it’s not running all the time, you’re probably not in the game anymore.
Zeke (5/6): I’m amassing a team of snipers right now, because I know the war is coming. A lot of people in this game think the war is going to start one way, but I’m going to make sure that that war starts my way.
Debbie (1/2): Zeke is throwing out a story to get me and Tai to vote for Andrea, which I immediately was skeptical of. The first thing you always should ask yourself in Survivor is, “Is this information true?” It’s hard for me to take anything Zeke says at face value, because he is trying to form a coalition for himself. But I’m not in any frame of mind to be moving into the Zeke camp. I want to make a big move, but I don’t need Zeke to make it.
Brad (1/1): I think sides are starting to be taken, and you need to get on one or the other pretty quickly, or else you’re going to be on the small side. And it’s going to be a crazy Tribal because it can very well dictate the remainder of the season.
Zeke (6/6): After the Immunity Challenge, I get back to camp, and I’m happy that Andrea doesn’t win individual immunity, because I’m gearing up for, like, the battle of my season to get rid of Andrea.
Sierra (1/1): Zeke is acting like he wants to switch sides all of a sudden, but whenever I talk to Zeke, I feel like he thinks I’m stupid, and I don’t trust him, but if they’re saying my name, I just got to figure out ways to get the numbers so I don’t go home.
Andrea (3/3): I am furious at Zeke. I’ve been working with him since Day 1. I thought we were not only alliance members, I thought we were friends.
Ozzy (2/2): One thing that I’ve learned about this game is that timing is everything, and Cirie and I, we are good. I want her on my side voting with me against other people like Zeke.
Debbie (2/2): It’s okay if people think I’m quirky, and you can underestimate me at your own risk, but if everybody listens to me -- Brad, Sierra, Sarah, Troyzan, Tai -- this will go off and we will be massive Game Changers tonight, largely thanks to me, and I have an extra vote. I don’t want to use it this early, but I don’t know if I have the numbers.
Sarah (2/2): At this point, I am sitting in the middle of two groups that are starting to surface. The one group, Brad, Sierra, Troyzan, Tai, Debbie, they want to vote out Ozzy, and then there’s another group of Cirie, Andrea, Michaela, Aubry, and Ozzy, and they want to see Zeke go. I’m weighing out all my options, and to vote Ozzy out, that means taking out a big social and challenge threat right now. That’s the move to make early on in a merge. But then, a lot of people want Zeke out, because he’s a smart guy and he’s willing to make moves, and when you trust somebody like that, you will end up getting blindsided. So it’s a real tough position to be in, but a line will be drawn in the sand this vote.
Debbie (1/5): What I wanted to happen, happened flawlessly. Ozzy went home. We have complete control of this game. There’s not a line drawn in the sand, there is a line drawn in concrete, because now that we have Sarah, myself, Sierra, Troyzan, Brad and Tai, we are a six that are not going to be blown away by the wind or the tide. And now we’re going to pick off the five that are left systematically one by one.
Andrea (1/2): Tribal Council was a shocker. I was completely out of the loop. I thought we were trying to get out Zeke. So I guess I’m screwed. I’m in the minority.
Zeke (1/2): Obviously, I was not included in the majority vote, but since I know Andrea is coming after me, I need protection. So I feel like I don’t have any choice but to stay with the majority alliance.
Sarah (1/11): At Tribal Council, I had to pick a side, but I still want to work with Zeke. Having Zeke opens up options for me.
Sarah (2/11): As much as people want to think that the line is drawn in the sand, well, I hate to break it to people, but the tide comes up pretty quickly, and that line gets washed away.
Sarah (3/11): I’m looking over at Michaela, and I see a rolled up piece of paper that says “Secret Advantage,” and I can’t believe Michaela didn’t see that. With Survivor, to be a Game Changer, you gotta be looking constantly for idols and clues, and now I have a secret advantage. So this is a huge win for me.
Cirie (1/3): (tearfully) Although we lost the challenge, if I didn’t try to complete it… (sniffles) I would have felt like a complete failure. I just couldn’t let fear or exhaustion stop me or beat me this time.
Cirie (2/3): This is a rough game. We’re all vying for the same prize, but when it comes down to it, the people that are playing are really good people, and… (pauses) it showed in the way that they helped me today. I know that I’m not a challenge beast, so I’ve always just done what was necessary to get me by. I didn’t want to ever push further than that, because I-- it wasn’t really necessary. But doing that, I’ve limited myself in a lot of ways. I’m not letting my mind tell me, “Be afraid. Don’t do it. Just give up,” anymore. I-I can do it. And if I can’t win this game by winning challenges, I’m going to do everything I can to try to solidify my relationships in the game. It’s gonna be what’s necessary for me to win this thing.
Sarah (4/11): When we were leaving the challenge, I looked over at Michaela, and I see a secret advantage right at her feet. That’s called attention to detail. I’m a police officer, but the normal person that drives down the road would not know if the car in front of them’s registration tags are expired or not… (raises hand) I would.
Sarah (5/11): Having this advantage opens up options for me. I can completely flip the game.
Sarah (6/11): In the past, these extra votes have not been played correctly. I will be the first one to play this vote correctly.
Debbie (2/5): I am a captain in the Civil Air Patrol, the Air Force auxiliary, so I am a huge fan of airplanes. They don’t get to be in airplanes as much as I do, so it was really fun to watch their faces. I appreciate it because it’s looking at the world through a different perspective. You see everything in a whole new light.
Brad (1/2): Survivor 101: Don’t ever take your whole contingency on a reward. So Troyzan and Sarah got left off on purpose because I needed them to stay to be my eyes and ears back at camp. You got five on the outside, and all it takes is one or two to flip to them having the numbers. I need some people that I can trust so that the five don’t get together and contaminate our six.
Sierra (1/3): I can confidently say that I don’t know if life can get any better than it is right now today, because at this point there’s eleven people in the game, and it’s kind of great to watch the five people who are free agents get mad at each other and fall apart, when what they should be doing is becoming strong and trying to take the six out. I feel like the six is super tight. I don’t see why anybody should break, and I don’t think we will. As of now, I feel like I’m on the driver’s seat, and it feels great.
Cirie (3/3): I had a conversation with Sarah trying to get her to see that she doesn’t want to be on the bottom of Brad and Sierra’s little group. I think deep down she realizes that, but it’s just like me on the balance beam. She knows the best thing for her to do is to cross that beam, but she’s afraid.
Sarah (7/11): I promised myself coming out here that I will not make the same mistakes I made the first time I played. What I did in Cagayan was look for the safest route I could go. I sat back, didn’t make a move, and let other people make the decisions. That didn’t work, it got me on the jury, and not even close to a shot at a million dollars.
Sarah (8/11): There’s small windows of opportunities in this game, and if you miss them, you’re not gonna win. However, this game is all about timing, and I’m not sure the time is right to make a big move, but I’m ready for it in the event that it is.
Sierra (2/3): Luckily, one of my power six won immunity. So we have the power to choose who goes home, and the smart move to make is voting Andrea. Andrea is a huge threat in this game. She’s somebody who needs to go.
Troyzan (1/1): Wow, the Immunity Challenge, I guess on a scale of one to ten, was an eleven because I won and I surprised myself. And now there’s a tight alliance of six and we just gotta figure out who’s going home.
Brad (2/2): At this point, I think the six of us are so sick of Michaela that it’s very tempting to vote her out. However, I really think we have a bigger threat to deal with first.
Debbie (3/5): I would love to vote out Michaela because she’s highly annoying and just has a bad attitude. However, I’m a team player, so if Brad wants to take out Andrea, I’m cool with it. She is the biggest strategic threat, she’s the biggest physical threat, and you take the shot the moment you get the opportunity. The best time is right now! Go.
Sarah (9/11): The plan was made without even asking me, and I realized at that point, I’m not high in the pecking order in that sixsome. So it might be time for me to make my move.
Zeke (2/2): The thing about the power alliance is I understand where I stand with them. I just sort of have to sit with my tail tucked between my legs and keep my mouth shut and just vote how they want me to vote. And that’s not really how I want to play this game. However, to do this, we gotta bring in Andrea, who I have no desire to work with, but I’m gonna have to deal with it, at least for one vote.
Andrea (2/2): If Sarah’s willing to make a move, I’m totally on board, because I know I have a huge target on my back. Now, as far as Zeke, will I trust him again fully? Of course not, but right now, I’m looking for anyone that wants to play.
Sierra (3/3): I think forming relationships is super important in this game. And then me and Sarah are really close. We’ve really connected. So I still feel super confident in Sarah, and I think it will be absolutely amazing if we were at the final three together.
Sarah (10/11): I had this plan to blindside the power group, and then Sierra proposes this idea that me, her and Debbie are a final three. And I was like, “Holy, crap, maybe I’m not on the bottom of the six at all.”
Debbie (4/5): I told Aubry to vote for Michaela, in case Andrea pulls an idol, then Michaela goes home, plus I told her Sarah doesn’t trust her, because even though she screwed me over the last time I played, I want Aubry to think I’m with her.
Debbie (5/5): Down the line, I may need to use Aubry. And to do that, I need her to think I’m her best friend, and I think it’s working.
Aubry (1/1): Debbie reminds me now as she did around the time I voted her out of Survivor: Kaôh Rong. She starts to get cocky and then makes mistakes.
Sarah (11/11): I was thinking, I might want to sit in the final three with Debbie, but now she’s spreading lies about me. At this point, I don’t know what to do. If I can control Debbie, I could be in the top six, for sure, potentially in the final three. However, I swore to myself coming out here, I’m gonna make big moves. Whatever I do, it’s going to determine how far I go in this game. I’m gonna decide at Tribal.
Brad (1/3): Coming back from, uh, Tribal Council, I’m in shock. I was totally blindsided, and, um, six votes to Debbie, five votes Andrea. I clearly was in a great position before tonight. Now I’m-- went from being in pretty good shape with the six to being in terrible shape with the four.
Sarah (1/7): Tonight at Tribal Council, I was the deciding vote in which alliance was gonna get the majority of the numbers. You know, this is Survivor, and it’s Game Changers. Hopefully, if I make it to the end, the jury will reward the fact that I was a Game Changer enough to make this type of move.
Cirie (1/2): We took the control from Sierra and Brad tonight, but in Survivor, there’s never any rest at all. You have to be like an evil eye. You have to watch everything, because if you’re not watching, it just takes a second and the wrong move, and the next thing you know, you’re sitting on the jury.
Brad (2/3): Walking off, I can hardly contain myself. I’m going on the reward. I’m going to have an unbelievable meal, but more importantly, I’m with the people I need to be with from a strategic standpoint to change the game. It’s a win-win.
Sarah (2/7): I’ve never been in a helicopter. Super stoked. I get a window seat. Fiji, it’s a dream come true. I mean, it’s insane how many islands and how beautiful they are. The helicopter lands, basically, red carpet rolled out. There’s a guy waiting with drinks for us.
Zeke (1/3): I’ve never been to a resort as incredible as this place. I’m in the middle of a gorgeous, like, Fijian mansion. Life is fantastic right now. We get this beautiful meal and we just gorge ourselves, because playing Survivor is like climbing Everest. It gets harder and harder the further you go up, and you really have to refuel your body and your mind to slog it through these last days. It only gets harder every single day.
Andrea (1/3): Looking at the people in the reward, it would seem like Brad is the odd man out, but there is some weird bonding going on between Brad and Zeke. And as a Survivor superfan, I would think that Zeke would know better than this. Zeke voted with us last Tribal Council, but I don’t think we’ll ever get back to the place we were before he betrayed me, and I’m never going to forget that he did that, so I am a little nervous that now he’s going to go try to do something over with Brad. It’s super lame.
Sierra (1/3): It was a really crappy night. I mean, I got no sleep. I’m exhausted, and I’m still trying to figure out what the heck happened the other night at Tribal. It’s super humbling to be like, “Okay, I’m at the bottom with Brad, Tai and Troyzan,” but hopefully something happens where I can get into the numbers.
Tai (1/1): This is the first time ever playing two season I feel like I’m really at the bottom. I’m not telling anybody that I do have two idols, but I’d rather not to play it. The longer I am having the idol, the longer I’ll be in the game. But who know? If my name come up, I’m going to play it.
Aubry (1/2): Coming back from the reward, I feel so lucky. It felt like Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. It was awesome. However, I’m a little bit concerned about the fact that I feel like Brad and Zeke had time to bond with each other. So I think we need to kind of think very carefully about… who we want to take out in the next vote.
Andrea (2/3): You don’t want to be the person throwing out names, but you also don’t want to be the person that waits too long to make a move. So now I’m trying to put the target on Zeke. If Zeke thinks it’s the six that’s going to stay together for a few votes, maybe take one of those votes and actually blindside him.
Cirie (2/2): It would be easy just for us six to vote Sierra and go along, but Zeke is way more threatening to me than Sierra. He knows this game better than any of us out here. I played four times, and Zeke knows this game better than I do. Now I have to get officer Sarah on board, but officer Sarah’s real touchy about Zeke, so you got to handle officer Sarah very carefully.
Sarah (3/7): When Cirie presents the idea of getting rid of Zeke, I’m definitely not down for it, because I can trust Zeke, so I need to reassure her to keep him in this game as long as I can. I need to fill her in on what my secret advantage is. Typically in Survivor, you don’t want to show your cards, but sometimes it’s necessary to lock people in.
Sarah (4/7): I feel pretty good with Cirie. I think it completely calmed her and smoothed over the situation, but in the event that they want to flip the script, I could jump ship next vote and go back and work with Troyzan and Brad and Sierra and Tai, because I want to go with whatever side can get me further in the game. I find myself sitting in the middle, which again, works perfect for me. So I’m going to let the plans develop… and then I’m going to pick a side.
Zeke (2/3): Here’s why I’m nervous today: there’s an eerie calm about camp. These people, I don’t know what to make heads or tails. It’s been really hard for me to get a read on where the lines are drawn, and I feel like I sort of been handcuffed and haven’t been able to play like I want to play, but now the game has been broken open. And I’m finally getting to use my Survivor skill set, which is the running around and the scheming and the plotting and the voting people out.
Sarah (5/7): I feel good with Zeke. We’ve been together since Day 1. And right now we’re staying with the girls, but at the end of the day, I don’t trust them, I trust Zeke.
Zeke (3/3): I’m locked in with Sarah because I believe I can trust Sarah to the end, but I don’t trust Andrea and Aubry, who are a very tight pair. I need a couple options. Brad and I bonded on the reward, and now we’re getting to the point where I need to bring in Brad and Troyzan.
Brad (3/3): That’s music to my ears. I made tremendous headway getting in with Zeke at the reward. So in 24 hours I worked my way up very quickly, not without effort, into a good position. It will bother me if I have to vote for Tai or Sierra, but make no mistake, I am here to win the game.
Sierra (2/3): I really need it today. I’m at the bottom of the numbers. I’m not safe. I don’t feel safe. So I’m terrified. I’m hoping I can get back to camp, make a big move and they keep me here just another day longer.
Andrea (3/3): Now that I won the challenge, let’s make a bigger move here. I’m for sure safe tonight, so why not go for someone that’s been coming for me? And that would be Zeke. Initially we were targeting Sierra. It makes sense, we have six, they have four, why wouldn’t we just pluck one of them off? But my relationship with Zeke has been so out of control. We went from what I thought was BFFs to him totally betraying me, and now I cannot wait to get him out of this game. I know he’s going to come after me at some point, so that’s why this plan is so brilliant, because he won’t see it coming.
Sierra (3/3): At this moment, I’m reaching for straws, and I’m going to do what the girls tell me to do. Tonight I’m going to turn my back on my initial alliance, and I’m willing at any moment to throw any one of them under the bus. I’m kind of just trying to be patient and sit back and wait for the word and hope that it’s not me.
Sarah (6/7): Just because Andrea’s got a little bit of power now, she’s talking about potentially taking out Zeke this vote. I’m definitely not down for it. I need Zeke for a few more votes, but I really need to keep my mouth shut, because if I start scrambling around to try to save Zeke, I’m going to get in hot water.
Aubry (2/2): Zeke’s a really smart player. Zeke is obviously calculating things many moves down the line. And something you have to do in Survivor is you always have to strike before the other person.
Michaela (1/1): I don’t see how getting rid of Zeke right now is a smart move. They don’t seem to see that if you leave four people on the bottom, they only need one more person to be in the majority for the rest of the game. Zeke is somebody that I can trust to some level, because we have played together before. So at this point, I don’t want to vote out Zeke.
Sarah (7/7): Tonight is now about Sierra versus Zeke. This vote for our alliance is a huge decision, because right now it’s 6 to 4. We vote out one of our own, it’s 5 to 4. One person flips over, they’ve got the numbers. But at the same time, if I press the issue of keeping Zeke, they’re going to think I have an ulterior motive, they’re not going to trust me, and trust is everything in this game, so I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I have a feeling the deciding vote is going to come down to Michaela and me.
Brad (1/3): I thought myself, Sierra, Troyzan and Tai were on the bottom and one of us was going home, but come to find, that there was a whole diabolical plan to get rid of Zeke, but unfortunately we all put Tai down. So I don’t know that I have Tai anymore.
Michaela (1/5): Tribal Council was a heartbreaker. For some reason we decided to acquiesce to Andrea. The majority turning on each other after one vote just means there’s nothing solid in a big group.
Cirie (1/2): If the pair of Sierra and Brad stay together long enough and they can convince enough people to come back to that side, we’re back in trouble. So we gotta split that up.
Sierra (1/4): It’s a weird feeling losing control in this game and feeling like you’re at the bottom, because you have nothing to lose. You know, Sarah has been my closest friend -- not even alliance friend -- while being out here, and I feel like I really got burned by her, but she might be a key person to get me further in this game. I need to leave that behind us and somehow try to continue to work together.
Sierra (2/4): Sarah’s the first one that I’ve told about my advantage. I want to use it as a way to kind of weasel in there and be like, “But you still have me, girl.”
Sarah (1/3): Brad and Sierra need to be split up, and when Sierra told me about this advantage, it actually makes me want to keep her now because she’s given me information and she wants to work with me. So the door is opening for her to stay in this game and Brad’s game is over.
Andrea (1/2): That was a very, very difficult decision. Michaela was completely defeated, but Michaela’s very smart, and knows that this is a game, so we’ll give Michaela a day. She’ll get over it, and we’ll be back on track.
Cirie (2/2): Jared is like his mom. He’s not an island boy. He’s a city kid. You know, he’s never been anywhere. It’s huge to see him open to different things. The only thing that would be better than that is for me to make it to the end and win for him.
Brad (2/3): I’m very fortunate that my loved one is a former stud Survivor player. She’s a huge resource for me.
Brad (3/3): Michaela was kinda, like, angry after she was not selected. So hopefully Troyzan and Sierra are back at camp trying to convince Michaela to flip and get in alignment with us. Otherwise, I have to win immunity for me to be able to make it another day.
Michaela (2/5): I was really pissed off at the Reward Challenge, because they didn’t care about me and my mother. So I saw a huge opportunity to move myself forward in the game. Tai is awesome to work with, because he has no one.
Sierra (3/4): I don’t want to turn my back on Brad and Troyzan, and so I’m hoping that maybe we can pull Tai back into our mix and maybe have an in with now Michaela, whom I’ve never worked with. I mean, it’s a great opportunity, because she’s the type of person to get upset, feel disrespected and flip.
Michaela (3/5): I put Tai and me in a wonderful position. The stars aligned for us. We’ve got options: be with the group that votes Andrea, or be with the group that votes Brad. And we’ll come to that decision whenever it’s time to come to that decision, but at the end of the day, this is about Michaela and what Michaela is trying to do in this game.
Michaela (4/5): Brad won immunity and saved himself. And because of the whole idea was putting up Brad and Sierra, I think Sierra is in trouble, I think Andrea is in trouble, and it’s funny ‘cause everybody thinks I’m voting with them. So a couple of people are going to be blindsided tonight.
Andrea (2/2): Before the challenge, we were planning on taking out Brad, and Brad ends up winning immunity. So it does kind of limit our choices.
Tai (1/1): The original five say Sierra is the one to vote off tonight, but Sierra, Brad and Troyzan want to vote Andrea, so I’m weighing my options. Right now, I’m closest to Michaela and strategically, both groups want us. They both need our number.
Sierra (4/4): Michaela and Tai told me that my name is getting thrown around, and I’m absolutely terrified, but people have gave me their word, and it’s myself, Brad, Troyzan, Tai, and Michaela who are going to vote for Andrea. So I’m hoping that people are just looking at the big picture right now, and I’m not the biggest threat… it’s Andrea.
Sarah (2/3): So originally, I didn’t want to vote Sierra out, but Brad won immunity, and if Sierra goes, it is not all bad, because Sierra has told me about this Legacy Advantage and that she would will it to me if she leaves. Now the only trick is, I need to confirm that Sierra thinks I’m good with her to ensure that she gives it to me. I don’t want to vote her out, but this isn’t about making friends. This is about winning a million dollars.
Sarah (3/3): So now, according to Sierra, Tai and Michaela might be voting out Andrea, which is news to me. I need them to help me vote Sierra out, because I need that advantage.
Michaela (5/5): Initially, it was just get Andrea ‘cause she might win everything, but the fact that Sierra has an advantage further convolutes what’s the best move to make right now. Tai and I need to decide which way to go tonight. Sierra is a good person to get rid of, but we would like Andrea gone sooner than later. The question is, “Is now the best time?” It’s a great thing when the decision is in your hand as long as you make the right one, because if you make the wrong one, you’ll end up on the jury looking stupid.
Andrea (1/3): There’s little things that Sarah does that kind of raises some question marks, and this was definitely one of them. Sarah’s lied to me before. Maybe it’s time to get someone like Sarah out.
Cirie (1/8): Sarah’s been getting her work in with a lot of people… and fine for me. I like to take her to the end, and all the people she screwed over sit right there and decide who wins.
Sarah (1/4): Last night at Tribal, taking out Sierra was good, because she told me about this Legacy Advantage. She said, in the event that she is voted out, she’s going to will it to me. So at Tribal Council, as her name comes up, I look at her in shock, like… (shocked face) “I can’t believe you’re going,” and, uh, it worked (shows Legacy Advantage to camera), and Sierra willed me her advantage.
Sarah (2/4): And now I have two advantages. The first one is a steal-a-vote, which amounts to two votes, and the second one is the Legacy. So this time, Game Changers, I’m shooting for the stars here, and if I had to pick, I want Andrea gone. I cannot stand the girl. However, it’s gotta be the right time.
Andrea (2/3): For me, both Troyzan and Brad have voted for me twice, but Sarah’s so good at pulling people in. She’s very crafty. We want to get to her when she’s not expecting it, and I think that the next vote would be the perfect time to do that.
Aubry (1/4): I won immunity! Aww! That felt really, really good to have a high moment in a 33-day journey where I needed something to kind of start a résumé. Now I’m thinking a couple of steps ahead, and Troyzan is someone who is likable, but Brad is physically a big threat, so the time is nigh for Brad Culpepper.
Michaela (1/2): Brad is nowhere to be found ‘cause he’s off in the forest, so I volunteer to go find Brad and kind of just make sure that he’s not looking for an idol. And maybe we should get Brad to go fishing.
Brad (1/1): Michaela’s trying to be a princess and blackmail me into fishing for her. I’m not going to sit here and kowtow to some diva’s demands. I’m just looking for a way for me to get back in this game to be able to make it another day.
Andrea (3/3): I’ve been with Sarah since Day 1, and I feel like I have a great bond with her, but maybe Sarah is pandering to the jury already. Maybe Sarah is already pandering to Sierra as she walks out.
Aubry (2/4): Luckily, I have a little solace tonight. It’s really weird to have this feeling. I feel like I can see things a little more clearly. I am not acting on that gut feeling with Sarah, because I fully believe it’s time to send Brad home.
Cirie (2/8): Andrea is trying to work me like I’m a cheap suit, trying to hint around about Sarah, but I need Sarah to stay in order for me to make it further in the game.
Cirie (3/8): Everything out here is about timing and when to make a move. So at Tribal Council, should Sarah and I get rid of Andrea and drop our numbers down, or keep our five strong and go for Brad, because Brad is just too dangerous to keep around. He wins challenges. It’s a real difficult position to be in, but timing is key here.
Cirie (4/8): We sent Andrea to the jury, but we still have a lot of people in this game that need to go. And although Aubry is in our group, I can’t trust her that much.
Aubry (3/4): (tearfully) Pretty standard day for me in Survivor: up and down. Really feel great at the Immunity Challenge winning -- never happened before -- and I had a good relationship with Andrea. So naturally, she’s going to get killed off, too. Just my pattern in Survivor seems to be really high highs and really low lows.
Cirie (5/8): What was really bizarre when we came back from Tribal, Tai immediately runs right to Aubry’s side. Tai was like Aubry’s husband, and he was consoling her more than anybody else, which was kind of weird to me. Tai works people, and he works on their emotional side. So the way he’s moving around with Aubry lets me know that they’re some kind of pair happening there.
Cirie (6/8): Brad is safe, so now we have to recalculate what our next move is going to be, and I’m ready to take out somebody that is a threat to me.
Troyzan (1/1): So at the Immunity Challenge, Brad Culpepper wins. So I’m going to Tribal with my idol, and if I feel like I’m in trouble, I’ll play it.
Tai (1/2): I start feeling I better show the jury some big move. And Sarah the dangerous one. It’s scary time, big boy time… (chuckles) and little Tai need to gain feel confident.
Aubry (4/4): I think Tai has been drinking the Kool-Aid that he needs to make a move in this game, but if I want to make a big move for my résumé, if I don’t get Tai out of here before he gets me out of here, my game is over anyway.
Sarah (3/4): For whatever reason, Cirie wants to believe Aubry and everything that’s coming out of Aubry’s mouth.
Sarah (4/4): So I’m gonna give Cirie the advantage of steal-a-vote to hold on to. This way, if this doesn’t scream loyal, I don’t know what does.
Cirie (7/8): Sarah’s so confident in Tai that I can’t even get her to use her own advantage, so she wants to give it to me ‘cause she’s that confident, but do I play it tonight and save Sarah and risk Sarah being pissed off at me? I’m from the old school. If you got it, play it. So I’m going to use it, believe that.
Michaela (2/2): Officer Sarah is confused. If she’s wrong about Tai, it doesn’t just screw up her game, it screws up my game and Cirie’s game.
Cirie (8/8): The advantage is that you can steal a person’s vote and utilize that for yourself, which gives you basically an extra vote. However, once I do that, whoever we voted for, now after that has the option to play an idol if they have it. And I think probably Tai has an idol. (frustrated sigh) I need to get Tai comfortable enough to trust me. I maybe could tell Tai about the advantage, and I’m willing to use this to save him that they trying to pull a fast one on him, but I don’t know if he would believe that. Damn, could I pull that off?
Tai (2/2): Cirie just say she has an advantage. That she could take someone’s vote out, and she’s gonna use that vote because everybody’s targeting me right now, which is completely took me by surprise. Is there any reason why she would lie to me? Why would she make up this weird thing? I am completely freaking out. Can I use my idol? Maybe I should. I have two to play with. I don’t know. I’m terrified inside.
Sarah (1/9): I felt betrayed by Cirie at Tribal Council playing my steal-a-vote. So I targeted Michaela because Michaela is Cirie’s right-hand man. But now, I don’t know who I can trust. Fortunately, I still have the Legacy Advantage, which can be played at six. So I know I’m safe.
Cirie (1/3): I’m in a lot of trouble right now. Sarah is really pissed and thinks that I’m trying to pull an okey-doke on her. It kind of felt like, “Whoa, you know, I’m trying to do you a favor,” but as the saying goes, “No good deed goes unpunished.” Hopefully there’s something to be saved, salvaged. I-I don’t know.
Tai (1/7): Last time I played, I didn’t do any lying, didn’t do anything. And this time I said, “This is Game Changer. I want to play a little bit.” I felt like I was doing everything what everybody was doing anyway, but I got caught. Now I am “Tai, the liar.” I think I screwed up my game. No my option is limited. Luckily, I still have two idol that nobody know about. Maybe I can use them to gain trust? I need to have someone to lean on.
Brad (1/7): Tai’s whole game has imploded. He’s been caught in a web of lies. He felt so bad this morning that he wanted to make amends with me and he told me he had two idols. Now, do I really believe him? I don’t know. I haven’t really trusted Tai since he voted out Sierra, but if he’s looking for a home, I can definitely use him for a number. I can help him get further in the game, but I’ve got to have collateral. I manipulated him on the first one, and I’m gonna manipulate him on these two as well. He’s lied to me numerous times. I got no problem throwing him under the bus voting him out with his own idol.
Sarah (2/9): Given the drama that happened at the last Tribal Council, I’m not really sure where I stand with people, and this reward is what I needed. I’ve got to find out who’s willing to go to the end with me, and I’m gonna do whatever I have to do to solidify my spot.
Troyzan (1/4): The fact that Brad won was just outstanding. Brad and I, we’re solid as it gets. So if he wins, I win. And I have an idol which I can play either tonight or the next Tribal Council, which makes me feel safe. So I feel like I’m in a good place, but we’ve got stuff to do. We have to win immunities. We have to play Immunity Idols. We have to be smart.
Sarah (3/9): I’ve got the Legacy Advantage, and nobody knows about it. So I’m lucky that I’m safe tonight. But at this point, I have to go with people that are gonna take me to the end. I felt betrayed by Cirie at Tribal Council, and Tai, I clearly can’t trust him. So the only choice I have right now is to go with Brad and Troy.
Brad (2/7): Tai informed me this morning he has two idols. That puts Tai in a power position that makes me super leery, because I’ve seen him flip a couple of times. So I need to get back to camp and make sure everybody is on the right page ‘cause I don’t want any funky business with two idols tonight.
Tai (2/7): Brad come back, and he say, “This is what need to happen. Aubry’s going home, but in order to gain a complete trust from me, you can’t have both idol. You need to give me one.” And that raised a lot of alarm. I say, “Damn, I feel like a dog, someone leading me.”
Tai (3/7): Brad was really intense and he create fear in me, but he say if I do that, he’ll bring me to the final three. I say, “Great, now I belong somewhere.” But the back of my mind, I worry if I give the idol to Brad, he’ll make a fool of me.
Troyzan (2/4): Tai showed me his two idols and I’m like, “Holy crap.” I guess in some way he’s, like, reaching out like, “I want to be a trustworthy guy,” but at the same time, he’s still acting sketchy.
Cirie (2/3): At this point, Sarah, Troyzan, and Brad just came from the reward, and I’m not sure what they discussed. After last night’s Tribal, I’d be surprised if they wasn’t come after me. So I tried to tell Tai we need to pull all our differences aside and come together and get rid of one of those three.
Cirie (3/3): The only thing is, Tai knows that everything that happened to him last night was because of me, so I’m sure he doesn’t trust me.
Aubry (1/3): Once again, I feel like my life in the game is in Tai’s hands, which kind of sucks, because 10 minutes before Tribal, he’s having an emotional breakdown.
Tai (4/7): I can’t decide what to do. Brad, he order me around. It’s like a threat. At the same time, I don’t trust Cirie at all. She screwed me first. So… how dumb am I to fall on Cirie’s trap? Honestly, nobody really care about me. They just want something from me, and it’s painful. (breaks down and cries) I don’t know. I need to toughen up. I’m still here. I still have two idol, and I just have to figure out what’s best for me.
Aubry (2/3): Brad smoked us all, and the tough part is Brad doesn’t seem to really want to work with me. So I feel like I could be going home. So I’m going to make a pitch to save myself, but I need the numbers right now.
Brad (3/7): I won my fourth individual immunity today. Walking into those challenges, I’m so focused on what I’ve got to do that all I think about is the challenge itself. Being a part of the record is a side note. My eye is on the prize and I think I’m really close to being able to take the bell.
Troyzan (3/4): My alliance is solid with Brad, and Sarah is with us as well. That’s a majority. So we’re going to vote out Aubry next, because when it comes to the Final Tribal Council speeches, Tai is easier to beat. But you tell me what’s been easy in this game, and I’ll-I’ll-I’ll be like… (makes zero hand gesture) this. This is what-- zero. Nothing’s been easy.
Aubry (3/3): If Brad wins the Immunity Challenge tomorrow, he will be taking Troyzan to the finale with him. Then Sarah and Tai each have a 50% shot at vying for that final spot. If, however, we make a move tonight together to take out Troyzan, that leaves two spots open.
Sarah (4/9): The story of my game this whole season is I’m always in the middle. So I’ve got a decision to make tonight. But first, I need to make sure that I can trust Tai.
Tai (5/7): I love Aubry as a person, but she’s also a really good player. So she’s the one need to go home, because I can’t beat her.
Tai (6/7): Brad and I happen to want the same thing, but the way he talk to me is, like, I am the minority or subservient or something. It’s not an equal partnership. He has no respect for me. He’s intimidating big time to me ‘cause I’m a little guy.
Sarah (5/9): Tonight is huge. This could be a million dollar move. And sure enough, Tai is changing his mind again at the last minute. Tonight is actually the biggest vote of the game. It’s going to determine who will be in the final four. So Tai and I have to figure out which way to go.
Brad (4/7): After winning five Immunity Challenges, I’m clearly in control of this game. I’m in the final three, and quite frankly, I think I can beat every single one of them, but as for tonight, Tai has betrayed me the entire game, so he’s going home, and it’s good to be the king.
Brad (5/7): I knew I was going to win that challenge. I was so prepared mentally, that in my head, I’d already won it before I started. And this necklace makes me Superman, it makes me bulletproof. I’m going to the final three and it’s my decision as far as who’s going home and it comes down to who has done me wrong the most, and that would be Tai.
Brad (6/7): As far as the jury is concerned, after winning five Immunity Challenges, I know that I can beat both Troyzan and Sarah, because after football, I became a trial attorney, so I think I can sell my case better to the jury. So I’m in control, and Tai is going to get what he deserves.
Tai (7/7): Right now, I think the most obvious, logical conclusion is Brad will vote me out for betraying him so many time and now my life’s on the line. I have to come up with something. Otherwise, all this for nothing.
Sarah (6/9): Brad and Troyzan have been tight the entire game, so, clearly, they’re going to make a move against me or Tai. So when he said, “Let’s vote for Troyzan, and force a tie,” which would come down to a fire-making challenge, I have to consider it, even though it scares the crap out of me. Brad’s pretty cocky right now and thinks he’s calling the shots. But I’m thinking, “Screw that.” If I can win a fire-making challenge, I can decide who’s going to the final three.
Sarah (7/9): Tai’s telling me that he can’t win, but he’s made moves and found three idols. So he has a résumé. However, Tai is so all over the place, he might have alienated the jury. And then there’s Troyzan, who hasn’t done anything without Brad’s permission this whole game. But at the same time, he hasn’t made anyone mad. And Sandra won twice by not making anyone mad.
Sarah (8/9): If I do this and win, I could rack up a ton of points with the jury, but I have to decide if this is a risk that I’m willing to take. It’s a coin flip, and I’ve got to pick heads or tails.
Troyzan (4/4): This was a dream that I truly put out there 16 years ago when I watched the first episode. I’m like, “I want to be the Sole Survivor.” And to get to the three almost feels like I’m there. My social game was real. I have the ability to speak to people openly, and I worked that angle from the bottom to the middle to the top the whole game. I think that’s what helped me because people did trust me, never wrote my name down, and I got to Day 39. Maybe this season, your personality, your loyalty, your gameplay from the inside, maybe will count more. And I got a good feeling about this.
Sarah (9/9): Knowing that I am in the final three is the best feeling in the world. It’s what you dream of when Jeff says the word “Go!” on Day 1. I worked my butt off to get here. I made moves that other people were scared to make. I made moves that I was scared to make. And I’m very proud of how I played. As a police officer, I don’t respect being lied to. It makes me feel like you think that I’m stupid. But I’m the criminal tonight. And those people on the jury are the police officers. So if they’re asking for the truth, I’m going to give them the truth, because I reward honesty. I hope they reward my honesty tonight.
Brad (7/7): The whole day I’ve been thinking about, “Okay, what have I done?” And I feel that I’m in a good position because I’ve been a Game Changer and maneuvered my way to where I controlled my destiny this entire game. I’ve won five Immunity Challenges. I put myself here. I wasn’t drug here. I did it on my own. And I brought the people that I wanted with me here. I don’t need the money, but I desperately want to win. Winning the game of Survivor means everything to me. And I can argue my case at the end of the day and walk out of trial thinking, “I’ve got it. Slam dunk.” But quite frankly, I have not been in a trial on a million dollar case. So, I’m kind of in a trial for a million dollar case tonight.
