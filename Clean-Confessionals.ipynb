      "{'Sarah': (1, [\"I played Survivor: Cagayan, and I have a phenomenal social game. I'm a police officer, so I can read people, and with a season called Game Changers, I feel like somebody will get anxious and feel as though they need to make a move, which will put a target on their back, and then I'm going to be the silent assassin. (laughs)\", \"I told Cirie I'm good with her, but if someone's going to throw her name out, I'm gonna go with it. Last time I played like a cop, look where it got me. This time I'm playing like a criminal, and we'll see where it gets me. My word is not my bond in this game this time.\", \"Tavua, who started literally from scratch, has somehow banded together, and we're just, like, dominating stuff now. But I don't want to be overconfident. In the event that something crazy happens, I need options.\", \"At this point, Troyzan's the odd one out against me and the other four, but the set four, that's stupid. That's boring. I don't like it. Let's grow up. Come on. I'm completely playing this game like a criminal this time. I know how criminals lie to me. So I know how to lie to these people.\", \"The reason Sandra has won twice is because she doesn't come off as the most dangerous person in this game. I almost feel like the way Sandra talks to people is she's grooming us. She doesn't pressure you. Her voice never raises. It's calm. And she just starts to suck you in.\", 'Today, after the reward, Varner starts saying, \"I really want to work with you guys.\" And I think we can pull Varner and actually use him as a number. And I really, truly feel like we have made that connection.', 'Then he says, \"Could Ozzy potentially be the vote?\" So that\\'s what I\\'m thinking of right now. I need to be careful because that\\'s a huge move, but I\\'m ready to prove why I am a Game Changer. We\\'re close to a merge, and we need to take out who is the biggest threat. It might be time to cut Ozzy\\'s throat.', 'Zeke sat him down and said, \"The girls are gonna lie to you just to make you feel good.\" And I\\'m like, \"What?! Why would you throw us under the bus so you could save face?\" Things are starting to look weird now. Zeke doesn\\'t really want to get rid of Ozzy and Zeke threw Andrea and I under the bus. I\\'m like, \"This kind of is starting to stink. Do Zeke and Ozzy have something more going on that I don\\'t know about?\" And that really scares me. This could be a huge mistake, but maybe we need to get rid of Ozzy and keep Varner.', 'You know, I come from a very conservative background. I don’t know any transgender people until now, and the fact that I’ve been with Zeke and gotten to know him as a person from Day 1… I love that guy, and it doesn’t change who he is to me. If anything, it makes us stronger, I feel. So I woke up this morning, and Zeke is Zeke.', 'We lost the Marshalls spa day, and it’s a huge letdown, but I’m finding myself in the middle. I have options. And it’s just going to be which group wants to vote out the person that I want to vote out. That’s where I’m going to go.', 'At this point, I am sitting in the middle of two groups that are starting to surface. The one group, Brad, Sierra, Troyzan, Tai, Debbie, they want to vote out Ozzy, and then there’s another group of Cirie, Andrea, Michaela, Aubry, and Ozzy, and they want to see Zeke go. I’m weighing out all my options, and to vote Ozzy out, that means taking out a big social and challenge threat right now. That’s the move to make early on in a merge. But then, a lot of people want Zeke out, because he’s a smart guy and he’s willing to make moves, and when you trust somebody like that, you will end up getting blindsided. So it’s a real tough position to be in, but a line will be drawn in the sand this vote.', 'At Tribal Council, I had to pick a side, but I still want to work with Zeke. Having Zeke opens up options for me.', 'As much as people want to think that the line is drawn in the sand, well, I hate to break it to people, but the tide comes up pretty quickly, and that line gets washed away.', 'I’m looking over at Michaela, and I see a rolled up piece of paper that says “Secret Advantage,” and I can’t believe Michaela didn’t see that. With Survivor, to be a Game Changer, you gotta be looking constantly for idols and clues, and now I have a secret advantage. So this is a huge win for me.', 'When we were leaving the challenge, I looked over at Michaela, and I see a secret advantage right at her feet. That’s called attention to detail. I’m a police officer, but the normal person that drives down the road would not know if the car in front of them’s registration tags are expired or not… (raises hand) I would.', 'Having this advantage opens up options for me. I can completely flip the game.', 'In the past, these extra votes have not been played correctly. I will be the first one to play this vote correctly.', 'I promised myself coming out here that I will not make the same mistakes I made the first time I played. What I did in Cagayan was look for the safest route I could go. I sat back, didn’t make a move, and let other people make the decisions. That didn’t work, it got me on the jury, and not even close to a shot at a million dollars.', 'There’s small windows of opportunities in this game, and if you miss them, you’re not gonna win. However, this game is all about timing, and I’m not sure the time is right to make a big move, but I’m ready for it in the event that it is.', 'The plan was made without even asking me, and I realized at that point, I’m not high in the pecking order in that sixsome. So it might be time for me to make my move.', 'I had this plan to blindside the power group, and then Sierra proposes this idea that me, her and Debbie are a final three. And I was like, “Holy, crap, maybe I’m not on the bottom of the six at all.”', 'I was thinking, I might want to sit in the final three with Debbie, but now she’s spreading lies about me. At this point, I don’t know what to do. If I can control Debbie, I could be in the top six, for sure, potentially in the final three. However, I swore to myself coming out here, I’m gonna make big moves. Whatever I do, it’s going to determine how far I go in this game. I’m gonna decide at Tribal.', 'Tonight at Tribal Council, I was the deciding vote in which alliance was gonna get the majority of the numbers. You know, this is Survivor, and it’s Game Changers. Hopefully, if I make it to the end, the jury will reward the fact that I was a Game Changer enough to make this type of move.', 'I’ve never been in a helicopter. Super stoked. I get a window seat. Fiji, it’s a dream come true. I mean, it’s insane how many islands and how beautiful they are. The helicopter lands, basically, red carpet rolled out. There’s a guy waiting with drinks for us.', 'When Cirie presents the idea of getting rid of Zeke, I’m definitely not down for it, because I can trust Zeke, so I need to reassure her to keep him in this game as long as I can. I need to fill her in on what my secret advantage is. Typically in Survivor, you don’t want to show your cards, but sometimes it’s necessary to lock people in.', 'I feel pretty good with Cirie. I think it completely calmed her and smoothed over the situation, but in the event that they want to flip the script, I could jump ship next vote and go back and work with Troyzan and Brad and Sierra and Tai, because I want to go with whatever side can get me further in the game. I find myself sitting in the middle, which again, works perfect for me. So I’m going to let the plans develop… and then I’m going to pick a side.', 'I feel good with Zeke. We’ve been together since Day 1. And right now we’re staying with the girls, but at the end of the day, I don’t trust them, I trust Zeke.', 'Just because Andrea’s got a little bit of power now, she’s talking about potentially taking out Zeke this vote. I’m definitely not down for it. I need Zeke for a few more votes, but I really need to keep my mouth shut, because if I start scrambling around to try to save Zeke, I’m going to get in hot water.', 'Tonight is now about Sierra versus Zeke. This vote for our alliance is a huge decision, because right now it’s 6 to 4. We vote out one of our own, it’s 5 to 4. One person flips over, they’ve got the numbers. But at the same time, if I press the issue of keeping Zeke, they’re going to think I have an ulterior motive, they’re not going to trust me, and trust is everything in this game, so I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I have a feeling the deciding vote is going to come down to Michaela and me.', 'Brad and Sierra need to be split up, and when Sierra told me about this advantage, it actually makes me want to keep her now because she’s given me information and she wants to work with me. So the door is opening for her to stay in this game and Brad’s game is over.', 'So originally, I didn’t want to vote Sierra out, but Brad won immunity, and if Sierra goes, it is not all bad, because Sierra has told me about this Legacy Advantage and that she would will it to me if she leaves. Now the only trick is, I need to confirm that Sierra thinks I’m good with her to ensure that she gives it to me. I don’t want to vote her out, but this isn’t about making friends. This is about winning a million dollars.', 'So now, according to Sierra, Tai and Michaela might be voting out Andrea, which is news to me. I need them to help me vote Sierra out, because I need that advantage.', 'Last night at Tribal, taking out Sierra was good, because she told me about this Legacy Advantage. She said, in the event that she is voted out, she’s going to will it to me. So at Tribal Council, as her name comes up, I look at her in shock, like… (shocked face) “I can’t believe you’re going,” and, uh, it worked (shows Legacy Advantage to camera), and Sierra willed me her advantage.', 'And now I have two advantages. The first one is a steal-a-vote, which amounts to two votes, and the second one is the Legacy. So this time, Game Changers, I’m shooting for the stars here, and if I had to pick, I want Andrea gone. I cannot stand the girl. However, it’s gotta be the right time.', 'For whatever reason, Cirie wants to believe Aubry and everything that’s coming out of Aubry’s mouth.', 'So I’m gonna give Cirie the advantage of steal-a-vote to hold on to. This way, if this doesn’t scream loyal, I don’t know what does.', 'I felt betrayed by Cirie at Tribal Council playing my steal-a-vote. So I targeted Michaela because Michaela is Cirie’s right-hand man. But now, I don’t know who I can trust. Fortunately, I still have the Legacy Advantage, which can be played at six. So I know I’m safe.', 'Given the drama that happened at the last Tribal Council, I’m not really sure where I stand with people, and this reward is what I needed. I’ve got to find out who’s willing to go to the end with me, and I’m gonna do whatever I have to do to solidify my spot.', 'I’ve got the Legacy Advantage, and nobody knows about it. So I’m lucky that I’m safe tonight. But at this point, I have to go with people that are gonna take me to the end. I felt betrayed by Cirie at Tribal Council, and Tai, I clearly can’t trust him. So the only choice I have right now is to go with Brad and Troy.', 'The story of my game this whole season is I’m always in the middle. So I’ve got a decision to make tonight. But first, I need to make sure that I can trust Tai.', 'Tonight is huge. This could be a million dollar move. And sure enough, Tai is changing his mind again at the last minute. Tonight is actually the biggest vote of the game. It’s going to determine who will be in the final four. So Tai and I have to figure out which way to go.', 'Brad and Troyzan have been tight the entire game, so, clearly, they’re going to make a move against me or Tai. So when he said, “Let’s vote for Troyzan, and force a tie,” which would come down to a fire-making challenge, I have to consider it, even though it scares the crap out of me. Brad’s pretty cocky right now and thinks he’s calling the shots. But I’m thinking, “Screw that.” If I can win a fire-making challenge, I can decide who’s going to the final three.', 'Tai’s telling me that he can’t win, but he’s made moves and found three idols. So he has a résumé. However, Tai is so all over the place, he might have alienated the jury. And then there’s Troyzan, who hasn’t done anything without Brad’s permission this whole game. But at the same time, he hasn’t made anyone mad. And Sandra won twice by not making anyone mad.', 'If I do this and win, I could rack up a ton of points with the jury, but I have to decide if this is a risk that I’m willing to take. It’s a coin flip, and I’ve got to pick heads or tails.', 'Knowing that I am in the final three is the best feeling in the world. It’s what you dream of when Jeff says the word “Go!” on Day 1. I worked my butt off to get here. I made moves that other people were scared to make. I made moves that I was scared to make. And I’m very proud of how I played. As a police officer, I don’t respect being lied to. It makes me feel like you think that I’m stupid. But I’m the criminal tonight. And those people on the jury are the police officers. So if they’re asking for the truth, I’m going to give them the truth, because I reward honesty. I hope they reward my honesty tonight.']), 'Brad': (2, [\"We've all changed the game, so to win this game, you gotta go big or go home.\", 'In Blood vs. Water, it-it was so difficult. I had my wife Monica on one side and I had my side, but I came on and was very aggressive. This time around, I\\'m trying to let everybody come to me. And I find myself saying, \"W.W.M.D., What would Monica do?\" And I promise you that she\\'d be slow playing this right now. I got a long way to go, but I think I\\'m off on the right foot.', 'This is my new home, so I start thinking, \"Let me make this house a home.\" I love antiquing and I like to decorate. Monica and I spend a lot of-- we decorated our own house. I kind of relax as I\\'m doing that. It kind of gives me something to think about. We\\'re here, meager supplies, meager food, in an unbelievable game, difficult, but I\\'m having a lot of fun because it\\'s 4-2, and I\\'m thinking, \"I\\'m in good shape.\" The four of us Nuku are going to stay together, and it\\'s going to come down to either Hali or Caleb.', \"Truthfully, I wouldn't mind getting rid of Caleb first. Caleb, Debbie and Tai played together on Survivor: Kaôh Rong and that's the threat. I'm trying to bring in Tai and Debbie closer to me than everybody else.\", \"Maybe getting rid of Hali would be a better choice. But Caleb, Debbie, and Tai absolutely have a relationship, and if they wanted to team up, I'm sure they would send me home first, but right now I don't want to be the chief, so I would like Tai to make the decision.\", \"This Tribal is gonna be extremely complicated, 'cause now we're going with them having six against our five. I know that four of us are all gonna vote one way. We have one wild card, Hali, who used to be on death row. However, now the Survivor gods smiled on her and she's in a pretty enviable position.\", \"Today at the challenge, Hali rocked the balance beam, but Debbie couldn't get over it, and we lost the peanut butter. And she was adamant that she could balance, but now she's real angry, so I don't know what she wants. The only predictability of Debbie is that she's unpredictable.\", \"Jeff has thrown us some curveballs this season and this is another one. I end up on a tribe with most people I do not know. I got Sierra-- been with her the whole time. But while I was on the same tribe with Hali, we weren't really tight. And I never had a connection with Cirie. And I never met Aubry and Michaela. But we get Troyzan. Troyzan played with my wife Monica. I'm figuring that could potentially be a connection. He's also a man and I'm a man, and we're the only two men on the tribe.\", \"I definitely think Troy is an ally for me going forward. I feel good with Sierra. I feel good with Troy, but that's only three, and I need a majority of four. So I've got some more work to do.\", \"When Monica and I played Blood/Water, she got all the way to Day 39, and I don't know that I truly appreciated it until I, you know, been here 17 days. For her to do what she did, she's a tough cookie and kind of been a guide for me. I guess (points to Monica tattoo on right forearm) she's been my-my strength and my compass right on my arm.\", 'Cirie and Aubry both came up to me and just said it was so special you said that because they saw the real me and… surprisingly, made us feel closer and really galvanized my relationship between those two. Troyzan, Sierra, and myself have already got a good connection. So I think it solidifies the five people that I have on this side as far as whom I want to go with.', 'In football, you’re only as good as your next game. I made the merge. Awesome. It’s in my rearview mirror. I’m looking straight ahead. Who’s the next person gonna be? It’s not gonna be me. Tai and I connected prior to today on numerous occasions. I think I’ve kinda taken over his Caleb role from last season. So I think I can trust Tai going forward. And on my old tribe, Michaela and Hali were on the bottom, so I want to gun for them first.', 'My number one goal is reconnecting and strengthening the bonds that I had with people that I’ve-- haven’t been with, people that I maybe had a little rocky time with. Bonded with Tai. Debbie, she’s come back and apologized. And with Sierra and myself and Troyzan, so far so good.', 'You know, if I’m just thinking about myself and who I can play best with, I don’t feel that good about Michaela. Her reputation precedes her a little bit, and in the long term, I don’t really trust her. So right now I’m getting everyone together to get on the same page, and Michaela would be the first gobble up after the merge.', 'I think sides are starting to be taken, and you need to get on one or the other pretty quickly, or else you’re going to be on the small side. And it’s going to be a crazy Tribal because it can very well dictate the remainder of the season.', 'Survivor 101: Don’t ever take your whole contingency on a reward. So Troyzan and Sarah got left off on purpose because I needed them to stay to be my eyes and ears back at camp. You got five on the outside, and all it takes is one or two to flip to them having the numbers. I need some people that I can trust so that the five don’t get together and contaminate our six.', 'At this point, I think the six of us are so sick of Michaela that it’s very tempting to vote her out. However, I really think we have a bigger threat to deal with first.', 'Coming back from, uh, Tribal Council, I’m in shock. I was totally blindsided, and, um, six votes to Debbie, five votes Andrea. I clearly was in a great position before tonight. Now I’m-- went from being in pretty good shape with the six to being in terrible shape with the four.', 'Walking off, I can hardly contain myself. I’m going on the reward. I’m going to have an unbelievable meal, but more importantly, I’m with the people I need to be with from a strategic standpoint to change the game. It’s a win-win.', 'That’s music to my ears. I made tremendous headway getting in with Zeke at the reward. So in 24 hours I worked my way up very quickly, not without effort, into a good position. It will bother me if I have to vote for Tai or Sierra, but make no mistake, I am here to win the game.', 'I thought myself, Sierra, Troyzan and Tai were on the bottom and one of us was going home, but come to find, that there was a whole diabolical plan to get rid of Zeke, but unfortunately we all put Tai down. So I don’t know that I have Tai anymore.', 'I’m very fortunate that my loved one is a former stud Survivor player. She’s a huge resource for me.', 'Michaela was kinda, like, angry after she was not selected. So hopefully Troyzan and Sierra are back at camp trying to convince Michaela to flip and get in alignment with us. Otherwise, I have to win immunity for me to be able to make it another day.', 'Michaela’s trying to be a princess and blackmail me into fishing for her. I’m not going to sit here and kowtow to some diva’s demands. I’m just looking for a way for me to get back in this game to be able to make it another day.', 'Tai’s whole game has imploded. He’s been caught in a web of lies. He felt so bad this morning that he wanted to make amends with me and he told me he had two idols. Now, do I really believe him? I don’t know. I haven’t really trusted Tai since he voted out Sierra, but if he’s looking for a home, I can definitely use him for a number. I can help him get further in the game, but I’ve got to have collateral. I manipulated him on the first one, and I’m gonna manipulate him on these two as well. He’s lied to me numerous times. I got no problem throwing him under the bus voting him out with his own idol.', 'Tai informed me this morning he has two idols. That puts Tai in a power position that makes me super leery, because I’ve seen him flip a couple of times. So I need to get back to camp and make sure everybody is on the right page ‘cause I don’t want any funky business with two idols tonight.', 'I won my fourth individual immunity today. Walking into those challenges, I’m so focused on what I’ve got to do that all I think about is the challenge itself. Being a part of the record is a side note. My eye is on the prize and I think I’m really close to being able to take the bell.', 'After winning five Immunity Challenges, I’m clearly in control of this game. I’m in the final three, and quite frankly, I think I can beat every single one of them, but as for tonight, Tai has betrayed me the entire game, so he’s going home, and it’s good to be the king.', 'I knew I was going to win that challenge. I was so prepared mentally, that in my head, I’d already won it before I started. And this necklace makes me Superman, it makes me bulletproof. I’m going to the final three and it’s my decision as far as who’s going home and it comes down to who has done me wrong the most, and that would be Tai.', 'As far as the jury is concerned, after winning five Immunity Challenges, I know that I can beat both Troyzan and Sarah, because after football, I became a trial attorney, so I think I can sell my case better to the jury. So I’m in control, and Tai is going to get what he deserves.', 'The whole day I’ve been thinking about, “Okay, what have I done?” And I feel that I’m in a good position because I’ve been a Game Changer and maneuvered my way to where I controlled my destiny this entire game. I’ve won five Immunity Challenges. I put myself here. I wasn’t drug here. I did it on my own. And I brought the people that I wanted with me here. I don’t need the money, but I desperately want to win. Winning the game of Survivor means everything to me. And I can argue my case at the end of the day and walk out of trial thinking, “I’ve got it. Slam dunk.” But quite frankly, I have not been in a trial on a million dollar case. So, I’m kind of in a trial for a million dollar case tonight.']), 'Troyzan': (3, ['Tony is the biggest threat here. He\\'s probably the number-one Game Changer, and look, I already caught him digging in places like the idol weasel. I mean, like, he\\'s just… (smirks) he\\'s out of control. And then he acted like, \"Oh, hey, bro, what\\'s up?\" (laughs) I\\'m like, I didn\\'t confront him, but he had like-- I can read-- and when he\\'s guilty, he has a fantastic guilty face. But I got to be very careful with a guy like that.', \"Andrea, come on, man. She's-- she acts like she's my buddy, but she's a little devil, that one. She just-- I know she's playing a game. She's-- she's not as clever, I think, as she thinks she is. Come on, I'm 54 years old. I'm the oldest guy out here, and, you know, my intuition is-is good, and I feel like I learned so much from One World. And, you know, I found an idol then when I had to find one. You know, I won an immunity when I had to and changed the game. So this time I will not let any stone be unturned. I'm going to start to at least look for the idol.\", \"So at the next Immunity Challenge, ugh… it's just going to be crazy for me. It's going to be hugely difficult because I have two things to think about, winning a super tough game-changing challenge, plus I also have to find the Hidden Immunity Idol in front of everybody. But if I can do it, it's like a complete 180.\", \"This idol being hidden under this table makes me way nervous, because I'm in charge of untying knots. So I have to wait until after the challenge ends in order to nab it.\", 'To find an idol again is like, \"Oh, I did it!\" And finding this changes everything. It\\'s life for me. It gives you the feeling of power, and power is huge in this game.', \"I have an idol, and Sarah doesn't know anything about it, and she says she wants to work with me. So it would be a huge plus in my game not to play my idol right now. So if I could work with Sarah and keep my idol… I mean, that would be… (makes Ok gesture) the golden ticket.\", 'When Jeff said, \"Drop the buffs,\" I was like, \"Okay, this has gotta be some kind of good luck in my way.\" Being 5-1 on Tavua was tough, even though I\\'ve got an idol, I\\'ve just been sweating bullets all those days. So I thought anything that happens now could be good.', \"Brad seems like a really up and up guy, but I also feel like we're connected because we're just two guys on a tribe with, you know, five women. This takes me right back to my season of One World, and the last thing I want to do is get bamboozled by women again.\", 'Wow, the Immunity Challenge, I guess on a scale of one to ten, was an eleven because I won and I surprised myself. And now there’s a tight alliance of six and we just gotta figure out who’s going home.', 'So at the Immunity Challenge, Brad Culpepper wins. So I’m going to Tribal with my idol, and if I feel like I’m in trouble, I’ll play it.', 'The fact that Brad won was just outstanding. Brad and I, we’re solid as it gets. So if he wins, I win. And I have an idol which I can play either tonight or the next Tribal Council, which makes me feel safe. So I feel like I’m in a good place, but we’ve got stuff to do. We have to win immunities. We have to play Immunity Idols. We have to be smart.', 'Tai showed me his two idols and I’m like, “Holy crap.” I guess in some way he’s, like, reaching out like, “I want to be a trustworthy guy,” but at the same time, he’s still acting sketchy.', 'My alliance is solid with Brad, and Sarah is with us as well.

I have the ability to speak to people openly, and I worked that angle from the bottom to the middle to the top the whole game. I think that’s what helped me because people did trust me, never wrote my name down, and I got to Day 39.

It makes sense, we have six, they have four, why wouldn’t we just pluck one of them off? But my relationship with Zeke has been so out of control.

You know, I mean, that's his area, and it's kind of a slap in the face.\", 'You know, it was like a big feeding frenzy. You know, \"Kel\\'s got beef jerky,\" and they said, \"Look in his backpack real quick,\" and I was standing right there, and I did it. And there wasn\\'t anything in there at all. But still and yet, all I was thinking about, \"If I find beef jerky in here, it\\'s gonna be ugly.\"', \"I'll definitely feel bad about having to vote somebody off. There's some humiliation involved with being the first one voted off.\", \"To be honest, I didn't expect this adventure to be this hard. I find myself just craving food. Doritos-- I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world.\", \"I can't wait to get the food you don't have to work your butt off so hard to get. I mean, we have done fantastic on a small amount of food. You get food in us, and we're going to be unstoppable.\", \"The fish that Keith made was excellent. That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving. We were so hungry.\", \"Maralyn, she's kind of like our little song bird and our little cheerleader in our camp, so Maralyn and I have bonded more so than I have with any of the other people. It might be our ages, it might be that we just kind of took up for one another.\", 'Tired. That was a rough one. Cold... rainy... pretty miserable.', 'The mood in the camp is a sad mood, but it\\'s also a very strategic mood. Everybody\\'s thinking, \"Who\\'s thinking what?\"', 'I had slept outside last night, as did Keith. We were the first ones up, so we thought, \"First ones up, let\\'s just get up and go fishing this morning.\" So we cleared everything off the boat, got the fishing rods together. Jerri popped up out of the tent, ran, turned over the canoe and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.', 'I just said, \"Look, you know, we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We\\'re going to go fishing.\" And apparently, Keith wanted to have a talk with me, so he said, \"Well, Tina, let\\'s just go walk along the bank and fish that way.\"', \"You have four or five young people playing that they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second nature just to-- woo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider, which I am an outsider at this point.\", 'It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp, even though we know that it has to cross the water in order to get to us.', \"I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel?\", \"There was a little bit of it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was, if I could get Colby, that would be two of us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber, and that would be the only chance that I would have to make it. At this point, I don't have anything to lose.\", \"It's just extremely hazy and smoky, and... it's an interesting morning.\", \"It's not the things you lose, it's just losing. You know, it takes such a psychological hit on your already psychologically tired body, that, for our team, it's definitely the loss that hits us hard.\", \"I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to time out, but to be honest, I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know, you're always walking on eggshells around her, and it's just no fun living in that type of situation.\", \"Everybody here knows the importance of winning today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. That's pressure.\", \"You go to one camp or the other, and I'm not sure how that decision is going to be made at this point. It's important for us to get information right now about who's had votes cast against them, because it's probably going to come down to a tie-breaker vote.\", \"Glad to know it's not one of those things that's life-threatening. I felt a lot of relief.\", \"The importance at this point in at five and five, had a huge impact on the Ogakor tribes. If we had gone in at six and four, we would have been picked off one by one, no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ballgame, we're going into overtime.\", 'I don\\'t think it was a deliberate thing where he said, \"I\\'m going to take my matches with me so the girls won\\'t have it.\" He would not do that under any circumstances. It\\'s in Jerri\\'s best interest not to show a real hateful side.', \"It's nice, starting all over, starting on equal ground. And it was important to listen more than you talk, find out what you're up against.\", 'I looked over at Keith and Keith said, \"Tina, I need this one.\" In his heart he must have really thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him.', \"It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there, because I've been out there ten hours. I knew for our team that we... I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it.\", \"You go into a merger, thinking that you're very much allied with a team, but then, as time goes by, you might find out that there's people that are more deserving, you know? I want this to be on an individual basis, and I want the good guys to win.\", \"Ever since the beginning, the cooking of the rice has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor, and the same problem came with us to Barramundi. Basically, what it is, is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be... perfect, you know, or... you-you catch it.\", 'Poor little Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice, and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth\\'s feelings, because here she is, trying to help the tribe, and then to not be appreciated for it, and to be judged-- that\\'s very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth to say, \"You know what? You\\'ll get my vote.\"', \"The rain settled in here, and it muddied our water, and it's so cloudy that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from shore, and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.\", 'Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the order. We all agree or disagree on things.', \"And if we don't catch our food, we won't be eating any food. Here on out, you know, it's gonna have to be... everybody working together, catching... crickets, grubs, whatever we can find, in order to have people fishing, and that's no easy task on its own.\", 'I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of nutrition-- you know, I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread-- and it\\'s just... it\\'s just going \"rrrr.\" You know, my body\\'s trying to process it, and it\\'s just not going too good.', \"The water has risen considerably from last night, and we're losing ground, and we had our flag on the other side of our tent, and... I had to move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over there. And we're probably going to have to move camp today, actually. Today or tomorrow, no doubt. The water's risen, and it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly encroaching on us.\", \"Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing? No. He was asked to go fishing, but he said that he's never been before, and he wasn't planning on starting now.\", \"Nutritionally, you know, our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really what to do about it. Um, I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning, just making it out of the tent this morning. I'm really concerned about her.\", \"I think it was a fair trade if we can keep the rains away, as long as it's not a torrential downpour. We may get wet, but there's worse things in life than being wet, such as starving to death.\", \"We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps.\", \"That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days, which, to be honest, that's what I thought was going to occur.\", \"Amber's a sweet girl, but you can't get by just on flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own two feet. Now, she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than I made her out to be.\", \"I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was, you know, that's our home. Washed away our food, our cooking, our knives, everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest, I was just really, really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry.\", 'I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross midway and I saw that the current was strong and your adrenaline gets pumping, and-and you just know, I can do anything.', \"We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice can. It's just survival of the fittest. And I want to eat, plain and simple. I-I want the rice.\", \"There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it, you know? In the river bed where it's gonna flood, or up on the high point where we can get struck by lightning?\", \"I miss my husband and my children more than anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half, and my husband is my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them.\", 'Whenever I got on the computer, I could not type fast enough. I said, “We won. Of all the things that I wanted to win, this was it. I wanted to talk to you all so... much.” I got a major rush from getting to talk to my family. And I thought, that\\'s enough to carry me through another eight days, easy. “I love and miss you all more than you will ever know, and I will never ever go away again for this long.” I thought, \"Eight more days? Got it beat, girl.\"', 'After I won my reward, the main emotion was sheer joy.', 'I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another, it was just sheer joy.', \"I'm looking at the river, and it's running through our old camp. That is truly amazing.\", \"Whenever we very first started playing this game, we knew that there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end, it seems that, you know, we can joke around a little bit even, and we can laugh about it, and we can keep our sanity.\", 'We see Colby coming up, and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on, and it was Colby\\'s mom. She gave us all a big hug, and she said, \"This is a hug from home.\"', \"There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. And it seems that the day of Tribal Council, people are whispering and talking, and a little bit of paranoia sets in, too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off. You know, there's only four of you, and one of you's got to go.\", \"On Day 40, being here... becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor and I came here with the idea of winning challenges, of having an adventure, of doing well, I never thought I could get this far. As this game is coming to an end, I think that I have... evolved, that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist, and it worked to get me from 16 to three.\", \"For me, personally, I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so, I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way.\", \"It's been a long, long journey, and everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull, and now, you've only got three days left, and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over.\", \"This last morning, you know, everything seems like the last for the three of us, and it's just... I know it's a game, but still it's sad, you know? It's not just a game coming to an end, but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company.\", \"Every now and then, you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact, and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know, I can already feel the... anxiety of some sort in my chest, and a warm fuzzy, you know, coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be, you know, one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know, my gosh, we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard, but, uh... it's hard to say good-bye.\", \"I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. And I think that, you know, I've been guilty of living my life and, uh, trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and, um... and ver... fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life, the Outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you, and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home, I want to go back and for the first time really nurture my family.\", \"Usually, when we've left Tribal Council, there's been a wide range of emotion, such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off, that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth, and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp, and we were a little happy.\", 'Last night, coming into camp, just me and Colby, I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. I accomplished something that I wanted to do, and that was to make it to last two.', \"This last immunity, I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won, I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him.\", \"I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know, we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote, and we've kept Keith around for that reason.\", \"I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures, capturing those to take 'em home with me.\", \"I look at Colby. He came here for one thing-- to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason, and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open.\", \"I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp, kind of as a tribute.\", 'The shelter-- it was built with no food in our system, very, very weak bodies. That day, building that shelter was very, very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying, \"It was worth it, because look where I am. I\\'m one of the two. It was worth it.\"', \"What it boils down to is did I come here for 42 days to starve, to live in the type of environment that I've lived in, to make those type of sacrifices, to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars?

They just lapped that up.\n",

They're not voting me off because I'm not letting them.\n",

Nobody knew what to do with cooking the fish and so it sits here and it sits half on the heat, and it sits over there and it gets turned over halfway and it doesn't, and so it's half-cooked and overcooked and undercooked and half of the fish, half of the three rays were wasted... and that infuriates me.\n",

      "I probably won't get fish actually for a little while now, anyway, because they need to appreciate it. I'm bringing in too many right now. I brought in a bunch yesterday and a bunch today and so we need to take a break and let them kind of hunger for it again.\n",

      "When I fish is somewhat strategic. So I'm thinking to myself it would be a heck of a lot more valuable I guess to me, if I got fish after a couple more folks were gone. And I'll limit the fish that I'm getting so that I'm not out here working my ass off and people just expect that there will be lots of fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are analogies between my going out to the reef and hunting the fish and my picking off the, uh, tribe members one by one. I've been stalking them since before we got on the island. Bye-bye, baby. It's a slow, more methodical game here on the island with each of the tribe members than it is with the fish but there are similarities. That's probably the last fish I'll get until there are five. There are seven participants right now and I probably won't bother to get any more fish until there are five people.\n",

      "There's no such thing as... for me, a Tagi Tribe or a Rattana. That was the stupidest thing I ever heard. Or... or any other tribe. It-it never existed and it doesn't exist. It's a group of sixteen people, four of whom were in an alliance with me and a bunch of other ones.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Kelly said to me, um, \"Are you pissed off at me? It seems to me like you and Sue are pissed off at me.\" Well, that was my opportunity to come in and smooth things, as opposed to be the one who upsets the applecart. So certainly that little tiff between Kelly and, uh, Sue has been coming and plays to my advantage, absolutely.\n",

For me, this maintaining some kind of a thumb on ev... all of these different people's personalities that I care very little about, uh, is exhausting.

Cloudy, but I like the clouds. I'm just looking at the clouds, thinking of going home. Waiting... waiting... with no watch. Having no idea what time it is. Just knowing that time is passing slowly.\n",

      "It's bizarre to me how people do the things they do-- like how Sue and Kelly are washing each other's back and hair and, you know, laughing, and joking and hugging, and picking each other's zits and all the rest of it right now, after what they went through yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Check that out. Look at the road the ant highway, up on the, uh, ceiling of the, uh, hut here. The canvas. Two-lane highway. You can see the ants going in and out. Got a really great view from here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The balance of power I don't believe has shifted from me to Kelly, but certainly I've lost some footing. Kelly wins immunity, and all kinds of things have to change and shift quickly. So it's not as easy to remain a solid alliance in the midst of a lot of flux with so few people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time is kind of out of my head. I don't have a clock or a calendar or a watch or anything, but for some reason, I feel really, really comfortable, really good now. I, um, I think it has to do with just how short... how-how little time is left.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a wreck. My hair is way longer than I ever keep it. This feels like a mop. There's nothing left. I used to have a muscle here growing. I think I've lost a good 30 pounds since getting here, but everything's loose. There's nothing that's firm on this body anymore. Basically, I'm a physical wreck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was really shocked in the beginning by how few people were planning. It seemed a vacation to-to sixteen people who were told what this was about, who-who saw the logo that said \"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast,\" same as I did.\n",

      "When we got to the point where the original four were still here as the final four, that alliance had gone through a number of machinations that changed it from being the original four to almost anybody's game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had Sue not informed me that she had broken the alliance and established one with Kelly, I never would have known it and the two of them would have easily undermined me, and I could have gone at any point if they'd maintained that alliance. So it's kind of neat, cute, nice, that the final four were the initial four, but it wasn't a continuous line of \"Ooh, initial four make it all the way through.\" So there's a different feeling attached to it, not that, uh, sense of accomplishment I would've had had the trust been unbreached and we went through cleanly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last Immunity Challenge was standing there attached to a... an idol. I thought... “Ugh... no chance in hell of me doing that given who I was up against.” I felt I was forcing the game to go on unnecessarily.\n",

      "\n",
      "It's kind of nice to be one of the last two, and it's nice to have Kelly as the other member. I think I'm, uh, reflecting a little bit on-on what's happened for the 39 Days. I think I'm also thinking a little bit about questions that will be asked by the jury tonight, and how to approach some potential questions. It's an interesting morning, and I intend to stay completely out of the sun and try and do nothing.\n",

Even if we lost and I at least dogged the guy in the spear throwing, they'd be happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as losing the challenge today, I was a little irritated. Here's my dream come true. I can stomp a guy on national television and I miss by two inches.

I can live without the chicken right now.\n",

If they do, I'll just lead on with them like, \"Yeah, that's a good idea.\" But as far as the women forming an alliance and making one, no. It ain't gonna happen. I already got mine. I like mine.\n",

      "\n",
      "As far as there being a counter-strategy from the other side, yeah, there is some fear about that because we haven't got enough of them voted off yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "You think I'm going to come out and say \"Oh, yeah, we got four of us voting up against all you guys. We're going to knock you all down to the end.\" Come on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Rich came in with the fish, I said to Rudy, I said, \"I should go and stoke that fire up.\" And Rudy's, like, \"Oh, no, no, no, that's good enough. It's hot enough,\" and it wasn't hot enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish is tough to cook because they cooked a little bit and then they cooled off and they had to start the fire back up and cook the fish again, so Rich is sort of irritated.\n",

      "\n",
      "He's going to make a big point \"Oh, that ain't a lot to feed you,\" but it's a point that we did catch it. So, I don't give a (expletive censor) about how he's going to see it. I don’t care. We caught it; I feel accomplished. I did it… we've done it all now.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, yeah, he's going to be... I think it might bother him. In a way, I hope it does. I hope it bugs him, 'cause now he can't say that no more, you know? 'Cause us girls caught this one. \n",
      "\n",
      "The sun is out, it's going to be a nice hot day. And it's quieter. Sorry, Jenna, but, man, you talk a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't blame him one bit for not worrying about fishing till there's five people. That's a lot of mouths to feed, you know, and they don't appreciate it.\n",

      "Colleen and Gervase are just sitting over there and I'm like, \"You backstabbers.\" First you want him out of here, and then you're all over the food.\n",
      "\n",
      "My strategy all along has been to just play the role as a dumb redneck. People like, think rednecks are so vulnerable and dumb that they'll talk to them openly. Like Rich did, (laughs) you know, how he's going to burn everybody. Hopefully in the end the, the old redneck will burn the city slickers. So we'll see what happens. I've been knowing all along that I'm going to burn him but I didn't want to say anything to Kelly too early.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never trusted Rich. Of course I don't trust him. But am I doing a good job making him think I trust him? I hope it looks like I trust him now. Right now I don't trust anybody except for Kelly. I trust Kelly 100%. 100%, And she trusts me the same. We're like sisters.\n",
      "\n",
      "And it'll be 20 years come this Easter that I lost my best friend. So, coming across Kelly, somebody I can hang with... that's a long... I ain't going to ... her. I'm not burning her.\n",

You're not going to look good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the rain, well, I think it was a big deterrer on a lot of people. Really kind of ate at 'em. Oh, my God. I don't know if I'd want to live with some of them right now. Might be ornery, tired, hungry, cold...\n",

      "Aw, it hurts. This is my second ray sting since I've been here. Oh, and trust me, they hurt. It's like an aching sting and it hurts from my knuckle down to about here, and it's constantly pounding and it aches and it hurts really bad. I might act like a tough girl, but they do hurt. They gouge me. Yeah, this one got me good. Notice the hand. The knuckles are still swollen from that ray bite. I seen that tail come in and just slice that. Ow, was I pissed.\n",

      "We'll keep to an agreement that we'll treat each other civil till the time we leave here. No sense to make it hard on anybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I have one more challenge. There's no rewards, and you know what? I'm not even thinking I'm going to win anymore. But I want to win the last one, like, oh, man, if I win any-- I'm praying, I'm praying that I win the very last immunity-- if I'm here, if I make it through the next four, which I think I will.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're down to 60 hours. So, 60 hours, if you look at it that way, I can deal with it for a chance to win a million dollars, but the hardest thing for me here now has come down to probably the boredom.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's it like living with somebody you don't care for at the time... sleeping next to your enemy? You just do it. You just hang out with them and eat next to them, and just treat them like a civil person. That's all you can do.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Gretchen, she didn't vote in any of the way the alliance voted. She was setting herself up so that if she is the last two at the end she's going to make herself look really good, 'cause we knew there would be more Pagong on the jury than Tagi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, what it is is greedy. She thinks she got... like, five or six people ago, it's like, you could see her turn a little bit. Then I was really irritated. This has not been easy, you know, come out here on the island and get bit up by bugs and stung by stingrays. So I told Kelly my family's my number-one goal. I think I got a better chance of winning the million dollars with arrogant Rich by my side than with her at my side.\n",
      "\n",

I think that it would have been nice if we had fire, but we're not going to catch fish unless we have fire to cook it and I think that if we had fire, we could have spent a lot of time sitting around the bonfire at night maybe singing songs. We have a ukulele, you know, and, uh, that didn't happen and I wish it did.\n",

      "Been fishing all day today and still nothing. I don't even get a nibble. So that's, you know, really dissatisfying.\n",

I think that's when she finally got accepted amongst the girls.\n",

      "Rich, he overestimates himself sometimes, and we were kind of thinking that he wasn't going to catch anything. When you snorkel down there, there's nothing you can stab at. We have a good pole. I have my “Superpole”. Uh, which is, you know, it works-- in a Gilligan's Island sort of sense. We got some maggots, we got the “Superpole 2000” and we got the persistence of Dirk and me. We can't lose.\n",

      "\n",
      "I had this vision, and, uh, I thought I'd build myself a bowling alley right about here. That's what I'm doing here, slaving away. What I think I might do is, I might take some of those coconuts over there-- that are lined up like that-- I might take that bamboo over there and make, like, a little shelf where you can have the extra balls hanging up out there.\n",

      "\n",
      "Kelly thinks that failure to catch fish is failure to try. You know, I think she's equating those two, which is not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fish are not biting hooks out here for some reason. Either we got the wrong bait, or we're going the wrong time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's expected to get on each others nerves. Maybe everyone's on my nerves, too, but I just don't really act on it. I just wanted to be happy ? have a nice life here and that's it.\n",

      "Turns out that I'm pretty good with the blowgun. And I never really... never shot a blowgun before in my life. Turns out Rich is an expert marksman. Something we didn't know about him until today, so, uh... he has excellent aim when it comes to a slingshot. And Sue throws that spear much better than any of the guys in our tribe. She's a wild woman with the spear.\n",

I'm getting thinner and thinner. I think I'm using most of the rice I make 'cause I'm not bloated and my pants are getting skinnier. Very excited about it ? it's the way to start the day off, with a little bit of a bowel movement. Nice work, Sean. Go, New York, go! We were concerned about Dirk and his eating a while ago, because he was really disappearing into nothing. We're all losing a little bit of weight, but Dirk was really losing a lot of weight.\n",

      "Oh yeah, it's always in the back of my mind whether or not anyone's going to vote against me, you know. I don't have a vote against me yet, and now we're losing numbers so I'm sure one's coming, just like the other people who don't have a vote against them, one's coming in their direction, too. I suspect it might be Rudy. That's how I'll probably cast my vote at this point.\n",

They wanted it to be more romantic than it was ever going to be, but, uh... you know, from either end of us, but we really had an exceptional time, and we tied one on, you know, uh, finished the bottles of wine, and we ate like kings and queens, and, uh, it was fantastic.\n",

      "Jenna came up with the name. It had to be, uh, something that was indigenous to the island and, you know, we have a lot of rattan wood here. And, uh, we just added an \"a\" to make it sound more exotic. That was my idea. You know, give it a little flair, a little pizzazz.\n",

      "I love Rich, I really do. He's been a great asset to this camp, but he is a little immature in his motives at times. He's very protective about spearing fish and he brings it up at every Island Council: \"I'm catching fish. Don't vote me off.\" It's an insecurity aspect to him.\n",

I mean, it's just awful. It's so awful. I am feeling like I've been here for 59000 days. The past five days have been the longest five days of my entire life. I miss my old team. I miss my old beach, you know? I am the last Sole Survivor of the Pagong Tribe. I am a dying breed. Pagong gets picked off one by one. That's obvious. Now, I'm very confused at where alliances stand, and I think they're confused at where alliances stand. Rich and Sue are promising one thing to Sean... promising another thing to Kelly. Sue and Kelly are promising one thing to Rich... promising another thing to Sean, and then, Rudy just sits back and watch it all happen.\n",

I think Rich is the ringleader... Or if he's not the ringleader, then he's second in command. If I have to say, \"Do I know for a fact there's an alliance, and all this stuff is going on?\" No, I don't know for a fact, but I'm a smart guy, you know.

So they really only had their three core people: Rudy, Rich and Sue who probably definitely would be with the plan. That leaves four other votes, including mine that can go on somebody else. So somehow we have to work on Kelly and figure out who she's voting for and then maybe Colleen can also vote for that person. So, the best bet is Kelly.\n",

Sleeping in the forest is comfortable for me. I'm making a little sleeping pad. Sleeping pad, sleeping bag ? depending on how big it gets. I just used some bedding of debris or whatever I can find ? palm or the leaves that are around ? and pile up a bunch of debris. It's all a nesting instinct. As with everything, make yourself a nest.

Jerri popped up out of the tent, ran, turned over the canoe and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just said, \"Look, you know, we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We're going to go fishing.\" And apparently, Keith wanted to have a talk with me, so he said, \"Well, Tina, let's just go walk along the bank and fish that way.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You have four or five young people playing that they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second nature just to-- woo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider, which I am an outsider at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp, even though we know that it has to cross the water in order to get to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel?\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little bit of it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was, if I could get Colby, that would be two of us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber, and that would be the only chance that I would have to make it. At this point, I don't have anything to lose.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's just extremely hazy and smoky, and... it's an interesting morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not the things you lose, it's just losing. You know, it takes such a psychological hit on your already psychologically tired body, that, for our team, it's definitely the loss that hits us hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to time out, but to be honest, I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know, you're always walking on eggshells around her, and it's just no fun living in that type of situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody here knows the importance of winning today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. That's pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "You go to one camp or the other, and I'm not sure how that decision is going to be made at this point. It's important for us to get information right now about who's had votes cast against them, because it's probably going to come down to a tie-breaker vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glad to know it's not one of those things that's life-threatening. I felt a lot of relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance at this point in at five and five, had a huge impact on the Ogakor tribes. If we had gone in at six and four, we would have been picked off one by one, no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ballgame, we're going into overtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think it was a deliberate thing where he said, \"I'm going to take my matches with me so the girls won't have it.\" He would not do that under any circumstances. It's in Jerri's best interest not to show a real hateful side.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's nice, starting all over, starting on equal ground. And it was important to listen more than you talk, find out what you're up against.\n",
      "\n",
      "I looked over at Keith and Keith said, \"Tina, I need this one.\" In his heart he must have really thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there, because I've been out there ten hours. I knew for our team that we... I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it.\n",
      "\n",
      "You go into a merger, thinking that you're very much allied with a team, but then, as time goes by, you might find out that there's people that are more deserving, you know? I want this to be on an individual basis, and I want the good guys to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ever since the beginning, the cooking of the rice has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor, and the same problem came with us to Barramundi. Basically, what it is, is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be... perfect, you know, or... you-you catch it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor little Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice, and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth's feelings, because here she is, trying to help the tribe, and then to not be appreciated for it, and to be judged-- that's very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth to say, \"You know what? You'll get my vote.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The rain settled in here, and it muddied our water, and it's so cloudy that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from shore, and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the order. We all agree or disagree on things.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we don't catch our food, we won't be eating any food. Here on out, you know, it's gonna have to be... everybody working together, catching... crickets, grubs, whatever we can find, in order to have people fishing, and that's no easy task on its own.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of nutrition-- you know, I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread-- and it's just... it's just going \"rrrr.\" You know, my body's trying to process it, and it's just not going too good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The water has risen considerably from last night, and we're losing ground, and we had our flag on the other side of our tent, and... I had to move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over there. And we're probably going to have to move camp today, actually. Today or tomorrow, no doubt. The water's risen, and it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly encroaching on us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing? No. He was asked to go fishing, but he said that he's never been before, and he wasn't planning on starting now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nutritionally, you know, our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really what to do about it. Um, I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning, just making it out of the tent this morning. I'm really concerned about her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it was a fair trade if we can keep the rains away, as long as it's not a torrential downpour. We may get wet, but there's worse things in life than being wet, such as starving to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days, which, to be honest, that's what I thought was going to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amber's a sweet girl, but you can't get by just on flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own two feet. Now, she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than I made her out to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was, you know, that's our home. Washed away our food, our cooking, our knives, everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest, I was just really, really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross midway and I saw that the current was strong and your adrenaline gets pumping, and-and you just know, I can do anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice can. It's just survival of the fittest. And I want to eat, plain and simple. I-I want the rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it, you know? In the river bed where it's gonna flood, or up on the high point where we can get struck by lightning?\n",
      "\n",
      "I miss my husband and my children more than anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half, and my husband is my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I got on the computer, I could not type fast enough. I said, “We won. Of all the things that I wanted to win, this was it. I wanted to talk to you all so... much.” I got a major rush from getting to talk to my family. And I thought, that's enough to carry me through another eight days, easy. “I love and miss you all more than you will ever know, and I will never ever go away again for this long.” I thought, \"Eight more days? Got it beat, girl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After I won my reward, the main emotion was sheer joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another, it was just sheer joy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm looking at the river, and it's running through our old camp. That is truly amazing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever we very first started playing this game, we knew that there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end, it seems that, you know, we can joke around a little bit even, and we can laugh about it, and we can keep our sanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see Colby coming up, and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on, and it was Colby's mom. She gave us all a big hug, and she said, \"This is a hug from home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. And it seems that the day of Tribal Council, people are whispering and talking, and a little bit of paranoia sets in, too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off. You know, there's only four of you, and one of you's got to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Day 40, being here... becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor and I came here with the idea of winning challenges, of having an adventure, of doing well, I never thought I could get this far. As this game is coming to an end, I think that I have... evolved, that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist, and it worked to get me from 16 to three.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, personally, I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so, I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way.\n",

      "It's been a long, long journey, and everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull, and now, you've only got three days left, and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over.\n",
      "\n",
      "This last morning, you know, everything seems like the last for the three of us, and it's just... I know it's a game, but still it's sad, you know? It's not just a game coming to an end, but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every now and then, you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact, and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know, I can already feel the... anxiety of some sort in my chest, and a warm fuzzy, you know, coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be, you know, one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know, my gosh, we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard, but, uh... it's hard to say good-bye.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. And I think that, you know, I've been guilty of living my life and, uh, trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and, um... and ver... fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life, the Outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you, and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home, I want to go back and for the first time really nurture my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually, when we've left Tribal Council, there's been a wide range of emotion, such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off, that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth, and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp, and we were a little happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last night, coming into camp, just me and Colby, I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. I accomplished something that I wanted to do, and that was to make it to last two.\n",
      "\n",
      "This last immunity, I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won, I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know, we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote, and we've kept Keith around for that reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures, capturing those to take 'em home with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I look at Colby. He came here for one thing-- to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason, and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp, kind of as a tribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shelter-- it was built with no food in our system, very, very weak bodies. That day, building that shelter was very, very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying, \"It was worth it, because look where I am. I'm one of the two. It was worth it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What it boils down to is did I come here for 42 days to starve, to live in the type of environment that I've lived in, to make those type of sacrifices, to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars? Or did I come here to play this game and me deserve the million dollars?\n",
      "\n",
      "That trek let me know that this was for real. That was a long trek we had through deep sand with a lot of heavy equipment, and I was packing more weight than anyone else, so I was really struggling. It was a long trip, and that was... that fired me up, because that is the quickest way to find out what people are made of.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really did bring the flag to serve as shelter, but, you know, don't get me wrong. When I wake up in the morning, there's two things I'm thankful for. I'm thankful I'm alive, and I'm thankful I'm a Texan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith is just licking his chops. He's wanting to cook so bad, he can't stand it, and so you can bet he's going to work on this fire thing until we lick it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kel's done a little bit of fishing which just, I mean, come on, the guy couldn't fish a rubber ducky out of a bathtub. The bait choices, the-the lines... He's just going about it the wrong way.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you were looking to paint a bull's-eye on someone, obviously Keith has struck a nerve in a few people. Um, but also Jerri. She's certainly, um, a very strong girl and very set in her ways. Sometimes, uh, a little unforgiving in-in certain areas. So that kind of makes her a point of friction to some people.\n",

      "We haven't had any meat in a week now, and the lack of protein hasn't taken its toll yet, but it's going to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to think that, win or lose on this deal, that my stock wouldn't fluctuate at all, and people can say, \"Colby, don't worry about it. We don't want to put any pressure on you. If you don't... if you don't pull through, it's no big deal.\" But internally, I don't think that's the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winning this competition means a lot more to us than just bringing home, uh, a bag of-of fishing supplies. These are the days when it comes down to morale, and the mental edge going into this. And we're three and one now. The stats are pretty good for us. I certainly don't think this answers everything. We still got to catch the fish. The fish aren't going to jump into our camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most tension in the tribe seems to be between Jerri and Keith. With the cooking and everyone responding well to her cooking, (whistles) that put them on a level playing field there, and so there's not really a power struggle yet, but it could definitely come to that point. Even when Keith was over filleting the fish, I noticed there were several eyes paying attention, and what that tells me is that his stock didn't go up at all. You know, all he did was basically play the role of instructor on how to cook fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, Jerri... Jerri and I are getting along great. We've... every day we have more fun flirting with each other and seeing how far we can kind of push it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, I'm not sure if Jerri has ulterior motives. Jerri is-is very capable of deceiving me or anyone else in the tribe. And maybe she's not, maybe I'm wrong. But, uh, I still can't let my guard down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm dragging. This is the most tired I've been. Personally, I'm a little worried about myself. I know I'm not going to be as strong going into this one as I have been in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategies are starting to develop more and go in different directions, and the more we learn about each other, the more you start to second-guess what you've done.\n",

      "\n",
      "The powers that be have predetermined long ago the pecking order here, and-and... also the elimination order, and, uh, Keith is up. Keith and I spend a lot of time together. Part of my reason for doing it: one) we get along; two) we need Keith right now. So the last thing I'm gonna do is alienate him.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'd love to have a hog around here. They're here, we just got to find them, and I'm not having a whole lot of luck. But I'm bound and determined to put pork on the plate before I leave this place.\n",

      "Jerri's scared. She's worried that Keith and Tina and I are gonna join together and mastermind a backdoor move to, uh, to get rid of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerri probably wears a name tag that says \"Puppet Master\" on it. She loves having Amber in her hip pocket, and Mitchell in the same place. I mean, I simply agreed to go along with them just because I thought it could get-get me down the road a little better. I want to win, and I don't want to talk to anybody else about loyalties. Don't give me that crap. I haven't trusted anyone since Day 1, and anyone playing smart should have been the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, by far, is going to be the toughest Council for me because I don't agree with the order in which the union is voting. Because the person to go tonight is-is a huge asset and-and could really, really be an asset down the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "We really started noticing the smoke and hearing the trees explode and crash. Uh, yesterday, I guess, is when it got the closest to us, and now we're just completely pretty much overtaken by smoke.\n",

      "When you're asleep at night in the tent, and you hear moaning and groaning about Hershey Kisses, you know what's really going on mentally. It ain't about the chocolate!

      "\n",
      "Keith is a chef, man. You don't have to insult the guy by telling him he doesn't know what he's talking about. I think it-it's disrespectful and rude, and-and that's what Jerri loves to do because she knows it's going to ruffle his feathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we don't pull this thing off today, I don't think it's over at all. That seems to be the attitude of everyone-- just lay down and die if we don't pull this thing off. I'm certainly not going to just sit around and wait to be picked off by Kucha, once we merge. That's not happening with this kid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone was kind of going in their different directions, and I decided just to come upstream, and think about the game. You have to be a lot more selfish when you merge, because at that point it is all about getting yourself as far as you can go. You can't help but think about what's around the corner.\n",

      "\n",
      "My strategy was to make the Kucha guys mad, to convince them that I'm the man to vote for. If I can draw some attention away from Keith and Jerri, who both have several votes for them, we really need one of those guys to win immunity and the other one to be camouflaged. Because if the Kucha members vote for either Jerri or Keith, we're going down.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, the inevitable came. I was painted into a corner and-and had to lie to her to convince her that there wasn't anything going on. And I just said, \"Look, Jerri, Keith owes me one on this. He and Tina think that the three of us are going into the finals,\" which is the truth, but Jerri thinks it's just a ploy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerri doesn't deserve to win this thing, if for no other reason, simply because of the way she's treated the people around her. And that was the biggest decision when I had to choose between carrying my plans out with either Amber and Jerri or Keith and Tina.\n",

      "Last night, it was just... tossing and turning all night. The floor of the tent was uncomfortable. When the rain started coming in, I was on the end. Started getting some water flow in my side of the tent, just draining off the tarp that we lay on, and then wake up to see the rain like this, our fire's out. It's going to be a long day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because we're not having the fish, we're having to rely on our rice. We're eating a lot more rice than... maybe we should be. We're down to about two or three days' supply at the rate we're going. We still have eight people to feed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told Jerri as soon as we got in the boat, I said, \"Here's the deal: No talk about the game, no strategy, no talk about the other Survivors. Let's just enjoy the day for what it is: a day off... and that's it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerri was quite giddy on our little getaway. She made a comment to me about it being a honeymoon without the sex, and it couldn't be farther from the truth for me. I mean, we certainly didn't sit around and high-five and-and say, \"Man, we finally get our time alone together,\" you know? That's not what I was looking for. I was just looking for some down time away from the game and that's what I got. It's hard back on Barramundi Beach, being out there 26 days, going on a month, and not have anything but rice, so we're just going to go back in and try to be as humble as possible about it. If somebody pisses me off, then I'm going to just say, \"I got to go snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef. What did you do today?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Immunity is going to determine who goes next time, just like immunity determined who... who's going tonight. Nick comes over from Kucha, and as Ogakor, we're still trying to maintain some sort of control. We determined a long time ago that Nick was more of a threat than, say, Elisabeth and Rodger. So that determines why Nick goes before them.\n",

      "You know, we're in a spot now, but it's not the end of the world. My gosh, the human body can go days without food. Where the lack of food comes in is mentally, and you got to stay tough mentally to-to make it through a food drought like we have right now. And, um, you can sit around and say, \"What if?,\" you know, \"What if we would've saved?\" Well, we didn't. We don't have any rice. Woulda, coulda, shoulda, you know? If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know what? I had two grasshoppers this morning, and a frog. But the big ones, you can't even tire those guys out, man. They fly forever and are very scarce, so you can't sneak up on those. The ones everybody's been fishing with is the little bitty ones, which are pretty easy to catch. I haven't seen any lately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Keith... Keith probably has the upper hand on the whole, uh, grasshopper wrangling. Uh... a little more experience under his belt. You know, he's been at it a while, and-and, uh, he kind of has a handle on it. I've-I've yet to figure out his method, um... but, uh, I may have to go to the master so he can teach young grasshopper how to wrangle grasshoppers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amber's a little bit nervous about the fact that we voted Jerri off. She felt like she might be the next one that we go after. It could be potentially deadly for all three of us. She and Elisabeth have been bonding quite well. She could very easily go over to the guys from Kucha and say, \"Hey, look, I know they're going after me next. I want to jump on with you guys.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rodger and Elisabeth both know that we brought them along this entire time with the intent to eliminate them before we eliminate ourselves. And they are well aware of the fact that they've got to win immunity in order to stick around.\n",
      "\n",
      "The storm hit about ten minutes into the ride. We went right into the face of the storm, and that kind of startled the horses a little bit. Heavy, heavy, heavy winds. You couldn't see anything around you. It felt like hail, the raindrops were coming down so hard. There was so much water running, it really looked like there was water running uphill. It was bad stuff. Worse than any storm I've ever been through. I feel sorry for all those guys that had to go back to a very wet Barramundi Beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "That challenge-and-reward combination was tailor-made for me. To be able to jump on horseback and go ride out to a camp with a bunch of cowboys and sit around a campfire and eat beans and beef stew. I mean, that's something I would do at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel just about as fortunate as I have in 33 days to be able to not only get a warm hot meal but also get a warm dry bed to sleep in. It's a very bittersweet time, when you realize what you're doing, you know? Virtually, what I'm doing by enjoying coffee and enjoying a cot is taking that opportunity away from somebody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was hungry and I dove in, and the first plate I had just... went straight through me. I felt awful. We were so used to eating nothing but rice out here, my stomach just... it twisted and turned. As soon as that second or third spoonful went in, I knew it was gonna be trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unequivocally, the best peanut butter and jelly I've ever had in my life. I'm stuffed already-- we hadn't even broken into the bacon and eggs, and I don't give a damn. I'm gonna eat as much as I can here, and then I'm gonna go sit by the fire and eat as much as I can over there. I may have to stop and use the bathroom four times on the way back to camp, and it doesn't matter. Mmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciated the opportunity to eat incredibly. Just the opportunity, no matter how sick it made me and no matter how sick I feel now. I had that choice-- I had the choice to eat and eat and eat. I'm very fortunate.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is the worst-case scenario that could possibly happen-- returning to camp and having to see what all your tribe mates went through the night before. We tell each other over and over, \"When you win a reward, don't feel guilty.\" But, inevitably, you... you feel guilty. And it wiped everything out, you know, including a good portion of-of everybody's... emotional steam.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone's going through the ringer right now. And out of all six of us, I've been the luckiest. This Immunity Challenge is such a double-edged sword for me. I'm worried about saving my own butt, but a bigger part of me is worried about winning another challenge and how that's gonna affect the way I'm viewed.\n",

      "With the storm that came through and the shelter, that's the... the worst I've seen Tina. She was at a rock bottom. But Elisabeth's been that way for awhile. Physically, Elisabeth's run down, and emotionally, and she's the one we've all tried to nurture a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I think it was apparent to everyone here that today, at least for a day, strategy did not enter in our heads. And that probably won't be the case tomorrow, but today, we didn't care about winning a million bucks.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a material standpoint, we've lost a lot. I mean, we have our rice, and now that we know we have food, we rationed the rice for the amount of days that we have left. Keith is cooking way too much rice at every meal. All you've got to do is just make smaller servings, and-and he just... he can't get it through his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's a fool-- the guy's a bozo, and I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of dealing with him. And I don't take anything that Keith does for face value. I think there's an ulterior motive to everything he says and everything he does, whether it's cooking rice or proposing to his girlfriend online. I don't like the way he's playing the game, and I think he's trying way too hard because he can't make it on just being who he is. My game with Keith is done. It's over.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as what's wearing on me the most: time. The long days. That's the only thing getting to me, nothing else. And if it weren't for the long days, Keith wouldn't even get to me. I mean, I wouldn't be as volatile as I am if it wasn't for the boredom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your fire becomes, uh, what's been referred to as the \"Outback television.\" I mean, and that's what it is. That's your entertainment. You look and see how long an ember can burn or how long it takes a log to burn in half to where it collapses. And it's just one of those things. You color in a coloring book or you play a few games of backgammon. Or you get into a conversation with someone that you forgot you had three days ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cold, hunger, wet-- none of that can compare to the boredom. It doesn't even fit in the same category, as far as I'm concerned.\n",

      "Rodger's always chipped in more than he's had to with the tribe, whether it be fishing or boiling water. He's always up to do stuff. Being the oldest guy still here, he's got more energy than any of us do, you know, and I think it comes from his heart. Because we're not playing for ourselves now, we're playing for those who are deserving to be here. Rodger and Elisabeth and Tina are all three deserving to be in the final three. As far as Keith goes, there's not anything outstanding or phenomenal that he's done that has kept him in the game. Immunity plays a huge part in this because immunity could mean anyone can be along farther in the game. and at this point, anybody could win.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest struggle I deal with in the final few Tribal Councils is whether I want to sit beside someone who almost guarantees me the million bucks, or whether I want to sit beside someone who, if I don't win the million bucks, I'll still feel good about that other person winning. I don't even have my answer to that. I did yesterday, but it changed this morning, and it'll change again, um, tonight.\n",

      "I think my mom probably misses me the most, just because of-of how close we are. I mean, I know she's the one I miss the most, and I know she's the one that has gotten me through all this. I mean, I talk to her on a daily basis when I get off and spend time by myself. Obviously, she doesn't respond orally, but I know she's hearing me.\n",

      "\n",
      "Keith goes on little sabbatical walks. Keith and I haven't had a whole lot of conversation lately. I think Keith is trying to figure out exactly what his strategy's going to be in the next couple of days, and probably also doing a lot of thinking about tomorrow's challenge. I get the feeling that Keith feels like he needs to win tomorrow.\n",

      "The girls surprised me with a little car-warming gift in lieu of a housewarming gift, like when you get a new house. A lot of people you deal with in this game are-are disingenuous. They're just... It's not real. But with those two girls, I really believe it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's awesome. I mean, the car is way cooler than I thought it was going to be. And it's got some of the neatest amenities a vehicle's ever had. You know, you got a stereo in the back of it, not to mention a huge tent.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing you don't realize how much you miss until you... you're here is the touch and the intimacy of loved ones. Being able to hold somebody and hug 'em-- that's one of the significant, uh, importances of having my mom here, just because she brings some of my daily normalcy back to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning was awesome. Out of everything that took place in the last 24 hours, the hot shower I was looking forward to the least. However, now that it's done, I think I enjoyed it the most next to-to being able to visit with my mom. I had no idea having a hot shower would feel so good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right in the middle of conversation, Mom gets up, kind of takes off for a second and comes back like Santa Claus with a big burlap sack over her arm, and kind of throws it on the rug in front of us and says, \"I can't leave without giving you guys something to go on.\" And she brought back care packages for Tina and Elisabeth and Keith from their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's almost like a conjugal visit if-if you were a prisoner-- you know, having... having someone that can come see you, but you've got a piece of Plexiglas in between you and that person or something. It was, in a way, like that, 'cause it was bittersweet. I knew she was gonna be here, but I also knew she was gonna get taken away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so lucky that to... to have happen what-what has happened over the last day and a half, but now it's time to shift gears. Now it's time to go play. We got to go do a challenge, and then, inevitably, go to a Tribal Council night and get rid of one of those three people up there, if not myself. How weird is that?\n",
      "\n",
      "My only loyalty is-is to Tina. There's no other loyalty for me, so it could be Keith or Elisabeth I'm gonna vote for. I think both of them need immunity to save themselves at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still haven't made up my mind as far as who I'm going to vote for. It comes down to two things-- strategy or philanthropy. On one hand, you got who deserves it, who's a good... who's a righteous person, who needs that money? Or the other side is use strategy. How can I get that? How can I put that money in my pocket? That's something we've all weighed from Day 1-- how bad do you want the money?\n",
      "\n",
      "The environment and the elements here have probably been the most dominant player in this game. You've got the 17th player here, and it's the environment, because it's the one dropping you to your knees, kicking you in the butt. And every time you feel like you're getting up, you get knocked down again. Either the heat or the lack of food or the-the flooding, the rains... Something's going to be... You know, you're going to get a curve ball no matter what.\n",

      "Whether you want to admit it or not, you deteriorate. In 40 days, Day 40 is ten times harder than Day 20 was. No question about it. Because you're weaker, because you're tired, because you're-you're sick of dealing with everything you've had to deal with. And you've still got to play the game. You've still got to think about what's-what's at hand, and that's, you know, surviving the people long enough to get in a position to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trusting people in this game will get you in trouble. And even quicker, it'll get you gone, and that's-that's because it's a game. And in a way, that's where it parallels life, but in a way, that's where it differs from life for me, because the only person I've been truly 100% honest to in this game is myself, and in real life, I'm not that way. I'm an honest person. But I'm playing to win a million dollars here, and so if you trust somebody, it's your own fault. You're a fool for not playing the game.\n",

      "When we first got the Tree Mail... and-and reading through it, and it said, \"Giving back to the land,\" I was intimidated by that. At first, I didn't know how. I didn't know how to approach that whole statement, and it took a-a-a lot of time today to remember how much I've taken from the land. We've used it for our shelter. We've used it to stick food in our belly. And at first, I didn't get the big picture, but when you do stop and think about it for a while and really put your mind to it, you realize that you've been given a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was working on that totem, whether it was painting or carving or-or stringing beads or whatever, I was reflecting and think about... thinking about what the last 40 days have meant to me. I struggled with it at first, trying to figure out what I was supposed to do or needed to do, and then I thought, “You know, it's mine.” And it took me a while to-to grasp that, to think that, you know, there's not any rules. Just like this game, there were no rules. No holds barred, play it how you want and see what happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't want to think about leaving tonight. It's a very real possibility. This whole experience has been full of firsts and lasts, every day. But that's just one facet I don't like dwelling on.\n",

      "I think the three of us are very emotionally attached to each other right now. And if the word \"love\" comes out of your mouth, then that's the emotion you're feeling at that time, you know? I don't love the two of them like I love my family, not yet. I haven't known them long enough. But you still share a-a bond that I guess you could call love, I mean, 'cause you'd have to love some of these people to put up with them in the context that we have for 42 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's what being here for 42 days has done for us-- it's made us realize what we take for granted at home, and all those things in our daily living when we're in our comfort zone that we don't appreciate because we're so used to having them. Well, we've been out here for 42 days, now we appreciate those things back home. Now we appreciate those people that we've taken for granted and the little things they say, the way they say our name, and all those cool things that you can't wait to get back to. And that's what making these idols was about-- so that we appreciate and remember why we were here.\n",

      "\n",
      "Keith might've been the only way Tina and I could've gotten here. And trust me, we tried every way possible to figure out how we could vote Keith off instead of Rodger, but sometimes, you've got to bring along people that you don't necessarily want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think Keith earned the right to sit in a position of-of one of the final two in this game. I don't think he played the game in a fashion or well enough to deserve that spot.\n",

      "It's a great day. I mean, and it is only going to get better each hour that-that goes by, and we realize we're one step closer to tonight. I mean, it's awesome. Mission accomplished. I mean, we've done everything we can.\n",
      "\n",

      "In the game of Survivor, you've got to switch hats a lot. You got to wear a white hat part of the time, and sometimes you got to put on the black hat, and that's the only way you can do good at this game. You got to be the bad guy sometimes. You've got to be a little bit selfish, but hopefully, in the end, you wore a white hat more of the time than you did a black hat. Tina has played the game better than anyone else. She hasn't flown under the radar. However, she hasn't ruffled any feathers. She's stayed on course the entire time. I think she knew where she wanted to be and how she was gonna get there much earlier than I did.\n",

      "Winning this game means so much to me, and is so important to me because of the level of difficulty. Because it's been so tough to get to this point.

      "\n",
      "I've been selfish in the way I've played. However, I'm choosing to go into the finals with Tina, and that's not a selfish move, 'cause if I was 100% selfish, I would choose to go in with Keith.

      "When they came back with fish, they immediately said, \"Oh, where's the chef?\" The \"chef\" word's never been used before.

      "\n",
      "Tonight's dinner was definitely a success. Since cooking the fish, I think my stock's gone up, uh, a good amount. I think the team has, uh, been pretty excited about what I've been able to do for them.\n",

      "Oh, I think Jerri is, uh, legitimately attracted to Colby, but I'm sure that strategic play comes in... is involved, there's no question.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Jerri's approach is just a lot of... she wants to really feel important. She's already got Colby on her side, but she gets, you know, on his side rubbing his back and, you know, nuzzling at night, you know, that whole thing, sharing the blanket, all that kind of stuff. So it's natural for Colby just to gravitate and a little smoke screen goes up and so he doesn't necessarily see certain things. Or maybe he does and I'm just not aware of it.\n",

      "Mitchell's the weakest of our strength of getting a lot of heavy work done. You know, when it comes to the challenges, you know, he's not... Maralyn, I think, is stronger than he is in the challenges.

      "\n",
      "So, at Tribal Council last night, Tina and I had an opportunity to get a little bit a better understanding of where we sit within our own tribe. When Jerri was asked the question who her friends are, she made a point of mentioning Amber, Colby, Mitchell and herself, that they all get along best, and then, of course, she wanted to make sure that everybody was clear that she was here to win the money, and she's going to do whatever she has to to win the money. So, Tina and I were a little miffed by that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerri is perfect for this game. She will ride the team until it's time to take the knife out and cut someone's throat. I didn't come out here to be pushed around by a bartender- wanna-be-actress. Maybe it's time just to shake her world up a little bit. I can tell you one thing-- Tina and I are not going to go down without a fight. I came here to win the money, but now my motive isn't to win the money, but to do everything I can to make sure she does not win the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jerri likes to think that she is the leader in some way because Amber and Mitchell, she kind of leads them around a little bit. My goal tonight is to try to step in and break all that up. I'll offer my opinion to the team and see what everyone chooses.\n",

      "Jerri went to go fishing, and she needed the can, and of course, she hollered out to me, like her older sibling. I said we'll take them to the end and dump them in the water like we've been doing it, and so, she brought them down to the water's edge, down at the end of camp to dump them out and then she yelled back that it's not a smart idea to dump them in there, because...\n",

      "I have probably a little more patience than Colby does. But I can usually tell when he's getting a little tense and a little agitated. He'll... He'll walk away from it and just take a breath.\n",

Starting fire in the morning is really very, very difficult. We were out just doing our morning bathroom break, and I looked off to the horizon. I said, \"What is that smoke over there?\" We found an actual piece of tree that was smoldering from a forest fire that was probably two weeks old. God's giving us a present this morning, on this cold, wet morning. That was a huge find for us. It was the basis behind a great fire.\n",

I think what I spent so much time thinking about is my family, my children, my parents, and of course, my fiancé. And I know that I-I see the light at the end of the tunnel now. It's-it's real close now. You don't have a lot of control at this stage of the game.

And I am 40 years old, I got two wonderful kids, and have had-- like any other individual that's 40 years old-- have had failures and successes and highs and lows. In the last five days, I've realized this really is not about the money, and it shouldn't be. You should walk away from this with something that's far more valuable than money, and I will. I don't think that I have the opportunity to win the money. I don't think I'll be at that level. I mean, I'm close, but I don't think I'll be of the last two, and it's totally fine with me.

And it was frustrating, too, but with the water jugs and, you know, the water canteens, and... I mean, that stuff is just awkward.\n",

Maybe he is smart, saving his energy and sleeping all day to win immunity. If we're... if Rodger and I are out there, you know, blowing all of our energy on fishing, and Nick is conserving his energy wisely, he's gonna keep winning Immunity Challenges, and that's gonna leave a vote to one-one of us, one... you know, either Rodger or myself, and that's scary. That makes me mad.\n",

      "Knowing that that was the last Reward Challenge, and I couldn't pull one out was kind of sad. When you come so close to something-- you almost touch that car and have that warm meal, and then you don't get it... I want the prize at the end. That's it. Simple. And I was thinking a little bit about Rodger. I miss him. And I really want Keith to come back so we can eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colby's mom was... She was like the token loved one from home. I think we were all able to feel that love and feel that care that we've been missing for so long. I mean, when she hugged me, I felt my whole family there.\n",
      "\n",
      "To hear stuff that's going on at home, it makes you feel as if the world doesn't really stop without you, it keeps going. Our homes at home are... News is happening, and life goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing we tried to do in starting the fire was use my Bible, which I had brought along. It was my luxury item. And, uh, we tore some pages out of it. Uh, it wasn't the pages that actually had any scripture in it, but I would've used that. You know, if you're... you got to do with what you got.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a nice little piece of home when you... when you least, least expect it, you know. Then it said go to page 200, and then go to page 150, and we went through that about seven or eight times, I think, till we... till we finally came to the end. And it was a little sentimental for me, to tell you the truth, to hear it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday's Immunity Challenge was a big letdown. Uh... uh, not only physically, but emotionally. I think probably more so emotionally. As far as the Tribal Council goes tonight, which are... which we have to go to, uh, I don't think any of us are looking forward to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today's challenge is, I believe, is probably going to be jumping off a cliff into some water. Water is not my finest... my uh, finest point, so, uh, I'm a little apprehensive. But, uh, I figure if the rest of them can do it, I can, too, so I'm going to give it a shot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just, basically, learned to swim right before we came out here. Plus I'm... I really got a little fear of heights, too. I mean, you're talking to a guy that wouldn't even ride the, uh, Ferris wheel at the fairs, 'cause I just-just never did like heights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Michael does like to be in the limelight-- I don't think there's any doubt about that. But as long as Mike keeps delivering the food, though, that's gonna be a hard one to knock off, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have noticed the amount of work that Kimmi has been doing. And it seems to be a whole lot more than... than really just about anybody else. She's really worried that she's going to be the next one to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I always heard that the best place to catch them is where a stream runs into a river. I was out here looking for, uh, sinkers to make a new fishing pole with, and I found a little rock out here about that tall shaped like a heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me and her, it just seemed like we hit it off right off the bat here.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, we received Tree Mail, and I went out there to it, and it was a bird's nest. And it involves a challenge of building a chicken coop.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would love to have fried chicken tonight. It'd be the first meal where we didn't have to pass a piece of fish around six or seven times and everybody take a bite of it. Everybody'd have their own piece of chicken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mike got the pig, and, uh, we ate real good, but we wasn't able to save all the meat, so I guess we're going to eat chicken, so we want to have the ax... (scraping continues) as sharp as possible while we're... while we're doing the chicken in.\n",
      "\n",
      "It could be very interesting, Tribal Council. Right now, I assume that they think that I'm voting, uh... against, uh, Kimmi. More than likely, that probably will not be the case. The only person that I keep my word with out here is Elisabeth, and she... and I think she's the same way towards me.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the boat today, was... we were talking about, uh, voting against Alicia. And we would... we would miss her, she does a good job cooking, uh... you know, she's-she's athletic... and, uh... but there might be a little bit more harmony around, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rain, yes. We got to Tribal Council last night, hadn't been there probably five minutes, I guess, and then all of a sudden, here come the awfulest downpour, the heaviest rain we've had since we, since we've been here. I mean, it really came down, put our fire out. So then we had to use, uh, one of our matches to light a candle in our, in our hut. Got the candles going and, uh, searched through and found the very warmest, well, not the warmest, but really the driest clothes that we had. A lot of us had wore our clothes to Tribal Council that we'd been used to sleeping in. I know I did, for one. That was a mistake.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to either go win this thing or lose this thing as a team, I think. I don't think there's-- unless somebody jumps... jumps boat on us in-in mid... in the middle.... in the middle of the stream, which is possible-- uh, we're either going... we're going to stick together as a team. And, uh, possibly Mike's accident, uh, might have brought some of them to the realization that, you know, maybe there's other things more important than even the million dollars, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know everybody is nicey-nicey now, but I imagine that'll change. I think it'll be even more interesting once all ten of us, with the women and everybody, is in the big hut. There'll be some times, I'm sure, when things won't be so nice around here.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were a little... a little angry about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My idea was to originally build the, uh, hut up in the trees where you got some good anchors, and then the girls said they would like to stay down on the sand 'cause it sleeps better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tina out there, she has not had anything to eat all day long. She-she didn't eat any breakfast this morning. The rest of us all had about a little bit over a half a cup of rice. And I know they're getting cold, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the last Tribal Council, I just felt like we had been outwitted by Ogakor. Kucha's tribe could be picked off very easily. They're in a good position to do that. We could be an extinct tribe, no longer on the face of the Earth. To me, it's, uh, one-on-one, and every man for himself from here on out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in it to win just like anybody else. I'm going to give it my best shot. My game plan right now to try to assure my survival is trying to keep catching fish. If they're going to vote somebody off, it's going to probably not be the person that is supplying them with the food. And I think that is my greatest asset at this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody is-is real nice to everybody else, but then you can still see groups getting off and talking, and you know what they're talking about. You know, the million dollars for being the final Survivor is on everybody's mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was feeling sick. I thought I was going to vomit, to tell you the truth. I guess because I hadn't had hardly any food. And I ate the cheeseburger and now I think I'm going to have to make a trip over the hill to the latrine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got to have something to eat around here. Keeps everybody's spirits up if we got a little something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After seeing this, where we've got our camp is called a dry creek bed. I doubt it if it's dry right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had to wait two or three hours till the creeks had gone down. Everybody would... had kind of quit talking, but I knew what was on everybody's mind. Everybody was thinking what's going to be left back there when we get back there.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first come down the bank there, I could see some blankets hanging on the line, I thought, \"Oh, everything's okay.\" Then I walked another 20 feet where I could see on over, and I could see that everything wasn't okay. It-it looked like a small hurricane or something went-went through there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wasn't so much worried about him getting knocked down off the log on into the river. I was worried about him falling backwards. I was afraid he'd get swept down underneath that log and be caught on some limbs down underneath there, and there'd have been no way in the world anybody would have been able to get him out of there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had laid awake all night thinking about the shelter. And I definitely did not want to put it back down there on that sand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gonna try and get everything cleaned off this beach. We never know when we're going to have another torrential rain like we had a couple of days ago. Took out everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I literally cannot stand, like, to go up there and just lay around in that hut for three or four hours, just drives me crazy. I said “I got to get up and get out of here.” I said “I can't stay in this hut laying around.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what's going to happen at tonight's Tribal Council. I got the impression that, uh, it would probably be myself and Elisabeth, not necessarily in that order, would be the next two to be voted off. Well, Tina mentioned which one I felt needed the money the worst-- myself or Elisabeth. I said I think Elisabeth probably does because of, uh, Elisabeth's, uh, background and her mother being sick, and what have you. And I just decided that I would take the out first for Elisabeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really wouldn't want Elisabeth to know that I had done that. But Elisabeth and myself have become very close, and, uh, I've kind of watched out for her. And that's basically it, really. Basically the reason.\n",
      "\n",
      "(groans) I'm a little tired. This rice is very heavy. I really want to get there soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith says he's a chef, but... and it's not that I don't believe that he can't cook very well, you know? And it's not... I'm not doubting his talent. But I think it might be that he's adding maybe too much water to the rice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm worried about running out of food and running out of rice. And we've been trying to eat it sparingly, but... It's going to run out sooner or later and, uh, I would love to catch a fish out there or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today is Day 7, and we have caught our first fish so actually, that's not too bad. It did take us a week, but hey, it's better than two weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "There could be something going on between Jerri and Colby. I mean, from the very first day, she told me how cute she thought he was. And at first she didn't think that he liked her. And I was, like, \"Jerri, it's only the second day.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a concern, um, but... you know, I think we'll be safe, as long as we head for the water and everybody does the right thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're feeling kind of blah right now, and I'm not too excited to make that hike again tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we've had an interesting past couple of days, as far as, uh... Let's see, our last Tribal Council we lost Mitchell, which was a surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems like... since Tina was able to get Colby to sway his vote last time to vote for Mitchell, seems like maybe he, uh, might sway again to their side, but we're almost kind of fighting over him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food situation could definitely be better. It could always get better. We're not eating that much at all. We're definitely not eating as much as the other tribe is.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we lose the challenge today, that means we will be down four to six. The other tribe will probably just pick us off one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely difficult for us. I mean, we wish we had so much more to offer them. It's upsetting that we can't give them as much as they can give us.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was very weird coming back to the tribe after we had eaten our meal. Like, nobody even turned around to look at us. It was very uncomfortable. I didn't like the feeling at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around camp, we just kind of did, you know, daily chores and stuff. Keith and I went and got some firewood and broke some firewood up. Just normal taking-care- of-our-camp stuff, you know, and not too exciting, but just enough to keep us busy to make the day go by a little bit faster with nothing to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tribal Council's definitely never a place where I want to go. I hate going every single time. It's voting somebody off. It doesn't matter if you've been with that person the whole entire time or only a couple days. It's still really hard to do. I definitely want to talk to, you know, Jerri and Colby and Tina and Keith tonight to see if our original plan's still in effect. The plan was kind of just get rid of Kucha one by one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last night at Tribal Council, Jerri got voted off, and I think that the group definitely isolated me from their decision because they thought that I was too close to Jerri. And... I felt sad, not only because of Jerri leaving, but, I think, more so because it made me feel like my own tribe members didn't even trust me enough to let me know what was going on. I felt really left out, and I hated that feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is how much rice we have left to last us 14 days. This is probably... enough for one serving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Um, I could approach the Kucha people and go against Colby, Tina and Keith, and it would be four against three, and we could just pick them off one by one. But how do I know that I can 100% trust the Kucha members, that they're not just playing with my mind and just pretending to agree with me? You know, I guess I don't know if I can trust Ogakor people, too. They could be playing with my mind too, but I have to play the game. And the game's getting harder and harder as the days go on.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got our new rice, we decided we needed to be very, very careful with it this time. The risk of losing it again just wasn't going to be an option. So we measured out the rice, cup by cup by cup by cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope factors in a huge amount for your existence here. I mean, you always have to hope for the next day to come, hope for a fish, a nice night with no rain. And I just keep hoping that the next three days to come, I'm still here and the next three days to come that I'm still here.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back to the camp, we didn't really have much to say to each other because we were all just devastated. Well, Tina and Keith thought of going downriver and seeing if they can find something that washed up on shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were cold, and we were wet, and we were thinking at least we can light a fire and dry off. And we had no way of starting the fire. It was just devastating. I mean, it's like nothing else could have gone wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's sad to see another person go out of your group. You know, that's less people, less comfort, less conversations. I never, ever look forward to going to Tribal Council, never. I hate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even from the beginning, I was finding, like, people were automatically getting on people's nerves. Um, yeah, we were walking through the grass, and Kimmi was like, \"I can't stand, uh, Debb.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mentally, you need to feel like you're comfortable where you are. And that's why I built the kitchen. I mean, the kitchen serves, you know, little purpose, but it looks good, it makes you feel comfortable. It's noticeable that you're doing work, which makes you... makes people happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "We woke up in the morning, Rodger and I relocated the chicken coop, got them comfortable. And then all of a sudden I see Mike preparing to kill the rooster. Everybody else is sleeping, and I said, \"Let's wake up, figure out what our day schedule is a little bit more be-before we kill it,” because if we had killed that rooster, a lot of people would have been upset. We have to make decisions as a group for us to get along.\n",
      "\n",
      "We moved the fire pit away from our camp, uh, for some safety reasons. And we had it nice and close-- about five feet from where we all sleep-- so it was really warm at night. But we moved it away, and last night was really, really cold. You know, what can we do? We don't have any blankets, so we just bundle up.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's one more Immunity Challenge left. We have six and they have five, and, uh... that's a huge advantage because the pressure is on them to win the next challenge. And, uh, we're really hoping to go into the merger six to four, and that way we could just basically pick them off one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "We just got our Tree Mail for tonight's Reward Challenge. It sounds like we're going to be doing something at night, almost definitely. Um, and it says, \"to lead the whole tribe there can only be one.\" Um, so it sounds like one person will be leading the tribe through the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we have a really nice camp, and nobody really wants to move to a new place and, you know, where everything's real strange. And it would, you know, kind of be our home field, our home-turf advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "We opened the box, and people just start diving their hands in, which pissed me off, because I'm thinking let's at least make sure we're getting equal amounts, but Jerri and Amber and Elisabeth and Alicia just start yapping and screaming, and I was like, oh, I had to back up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been sick the last couple days, and I got up there, felt a little dizzy, knew I wasn't going to win and jumped off, and got a good hour of rest. So that made much more sense to me than standing up on that block and getting tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Uh, we got tree mail, and, uh, it says for our Immunity Challenge, uh, we got to keep others out of your land and fence, like, each... everybody off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The roof of my mouth feels like it's been burned for the last three days. I had en... like, three or four enlarged taste buds on my tongue, which just is terrible. And I'm feeling better, but my mouth is still raw, so I can't even drink water normally. It's just, like, ugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to get out of here and see one of the wonders of the world would have been great, you know. We're in the Outback, but we're seeing, you know, the same basic spot over and over and over. So, uh, to get out and see some really clear blue water and have a big meal, it would've been great.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I don't win the Immunity Challenge, I think I'm a goner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winning the Immunity Challenge is important to stay alive. You know, you get out there, and you try to compete and try to win Immunity Challenges, but looks like everybody is voting on tribal lines at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to go take a bath, so the whole tent doesn't smell like ass by the end of the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "For me, uh, not having food is-is a killer. The lack of energy and the heat and the rain-- it's all real, and, uh, tomorrow makes a month. And a month is a long time to lay on the ground. I mean, I'm 23 years old, I'm in pretty good athletic shape. My back is killing me. You know, I've been sick twice. My mouth is raw. Yesterday, I felt a lot better after I ate. You know, I felt I could do this for 13 more days, but today, I'm just, like, “Oh, God, please get me out of here sometime soon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I-I feel vulnerable because I still remain a-a physical threat to win challenges. Um, I won the last Immunity Challenge. I'm a big body, so I take a lot to feed. So, I'm feeling vulnerable. Um, if I don't win the Immunity Challenge, I definitely expect to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith actually ran ahead to go scout out where the camp was, 'cause we were all getting pretty tired, and the last leg of that walk was really difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got to our camp, I was considering at that point anything and everything anybody was doing or saying as a strategic move.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tension between Keith and I... I think him and I kind of... rubbed each other the wrong way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith and I didn't start off on a very good foot, because of some of the condescending mark-remarks he made to me, and he might very well not even be aware that he does it, but I'm not the kind of person to just let it slide off my back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Believe me, when he goes out, I'm hoping more than anybody that he's going to come back with some fish and some shrimp, and we will have a big seafood buffet. But it's not happening. And it's... (laughs) He's just, he's not a fisherman, obviously. He should keep his day job. (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "It just... it didn't make sense. It didn't make sense. Like, how could a gourmet chef not know how to make rice? I remembered that with flour and water you can create some sort of dough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith is very threatened by the fact that I made this tortilla this morning. That's why... I heard them when they went up on the hill, and they were gathering wood, and he was talking again about what he's gonna to do with the rice and the vegetables and this, and... you know, you just have to laugh. You just have to laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt a little bit bad about it, but at the same time, you know, I felt like it was time for somebody to come in and take charge and change the food situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keith has gone out of his way to compliment me a lot now, to, like, try and smooth the edges. And I see... I mean, I see right through it. I don't... I don't think his compliments are necessarily very genuine. You know, the morale right now is kind of low, but I think the tortilla made everybody spark up, so I'm really stoked about that. And I got a few other tricks to pull out of my sleeve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean to have your own team member possibly be holding food behind you and surviving on their own little private stash while the rest of us are... starving, basically, is not a good way to start off on the right foot with a bunch of strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, in order to put grass in your mouth, you have to go get grass first. And I don't think you get grass out of your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "He suddenly, at that point, offered his razor. And I think that that's the hugest sign of guilt is to give to the people who have just accused you of something that is very serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Kel is a liar and a cheat. And as much as I don't want to believe that to be the truth, he would probably be the first one I would want to vote off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the main thing that's been keeping us from getting fish is our fishing line, so this is a huge reward today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn't stop smiling. Keith said there were no fish. He said, \"There's no fish out there.\" Him and Kel both were saying that for days and days. They were practically jumping in the boats.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think right now, everybody's pretty happy that Keith is there to cook the fish that we've been catching. I know sometimes he says things to other people that kind of rub them the wrong way, but I'm probably the one who gets irritated with him the most. I'm aware of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd really like it if Colby and I got together. He's exactly my type, plus, he's a cowboy and I'm such a sucker for cowboys.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it came down to me having to vote for Colby... I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was at the point where it was almost out, and there was hardly any light coming off of it. And no heat at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody's kind of getting a little lethargic. The fish definitely helped, that was a big morale booster. But I sense we're kind of on a downslide right now and it kind of scares me a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's been five of us, uh, myself, Colby, Mitchell, Amber and Tina, who've kind of decided to all vote the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "At Tribal Council, Jeff asked me who I felt I had built friendships with. And immediately after I said it, I kind of sucked it back up, 'cause I realized that I was basically challenging people to vote for me. Which doesn't put me in a very good position.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is definitely the first time I've felt a little bit threatened. And I guess I deserve it after making that pompous remark... (laughing) at Tribal Council. Colby does seem to be the one we're focused on in trying to ensure he's not... changing his mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colby was pretty excited about going out hunting for a pig, and... I think it's a brilliant idea, especially with the fires right now, 'cause a lot of wildlife has been flushed this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Colby is definitely separating the game from any relationship with me. I think it takes a strong person to do that, quite honestly, especially… (laughs) when there's obviously, you know, some attraction between us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a little leery of Colby, and I can tell, actually, that he's sort of distancing himself from me a lot more.\n",
      "\n",
      "First merge with equal amounts of people on both tribes. We can't lose another Immunity Challenge, so the pressure now is even more immense than it was before. The next two immunities are crucial for us and our survival at the merge.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We haven't been catching fish again, and the other team is eating chickens and pigs and eggs, you know, and here we are over here, starving to death. Those are the things that I didn't really think going into this that were going to bother me, but it has.\n",
      "\n",
      "I kind of took over when making the travois. I knew that the idea I had would work, and everybody was just kind of standing around and talking, and no one was doing anything, so I just kind of grabbed the bull by the horns.\n",

      "Everyone else in the camp is looking at it as if, if we lose today, that's it, we're all going to be sitting ducks, we're going to get picked off one by one. I see it almost as an opportunity to, uh, finagle my way into the other tribe a bit and mix things up, and freak some people out. If they're going to pick us off one by one, I'm at least going to cause a big ruckus going down. I'm going to wreak a little havoc.\n",

      "Today has been just so weird. I feel, like, a lot of distance between myself and everybody else right now. We do have the advantage now. We're five... Kucha's, to Kucha's four, but that's not relaxing me at all. It's the paranoia again setting in. We're in a situation where Tina and Keith could team up with the Kucha people. You cannot be complacent. Your back will be stabbed faster than you can spit.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ironically enough, I ended up being Colby's partner anyway. I think it's important that people are constantly reminded of the reality of our situation. There is nothing fair about this. And... you know, it's about winning.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's got to be a little, little bit of animosity and jealousy from everyone else for winning two rewards in a row. It bothers me a little bit 'cause I can see where that might affect people's voting. But on the other hand, I really couldn't give a flying crap at this point. (laughs)\n",

      "\n",
      "I couldn't have come out here with a better person than Colby. We're having a great time. We're getting to know each other outside of the game and outside of that environment. This is basically the perfect honeymoon without the sex.\n",

      "Returning to Barramundi right now is... I'm not really looking forward to it. But I, at least, am going back feeling rejuvenated and renewed and a little bit more like my true self, because, man, after 26 days of putting on the game face and being this tough, you know, don't-mess-with-me chick... I got a tender side, too. I feel like a little bit of that was touched today.\n",

We bring back the chickens, the rooster, the chicken feed, and, of course, in true Kucha style, we're trying to figure out how we can utilize every single little thing we brought back. Elisabeth and I said, \"Can we eat that?\" Because it just looks like nuts and grains and corn and wheat, and, you know, it just looks so good to us for some reason. And he's talking to us like, \"Yeah, it's good for you.\"\n",

And we're going to find out, like, somewhere down the road that, like, something was in it, and we're going to have, like, eight nipples and laying eggs, and I don't know, but until that happens, I'm going to keep eating it because it's so good.

Ogakor knows they're in a good position now to be the last five, but they also have to know that four members on this jury now are going to be Kucha members, and these people decide who's going to be the winner. They'd better start stepping up and being real nice to us.\n",

I'm not going to get sick. I will not throw up.\" So I sort of went into this little zone and breathed, and I don't remember any of it.\n",

They're not fishing. They're not doing anything. They're just talking, and, uh, the wheels start turning, and I'm just... my eyes are going around. Just because we've said what we're doing doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna happen, and I haven't been with these people long enough to know for sure how well...

Everybody was asleep, and I woke up and I saw Mike messing around with the fire and putting stuff on the pot, and I couldn't understand what he was doing.

I mean, I think they're good people, and I think that-that they're going to feel bad, and sincerely have compassion for us and for Mike. Um, but they weren't part of that. They didn't experience it. They didn't... hear it. And so that feeling of, \"Oh, my goodness!\" that it's going to have to be very quickly replaced with relief. That we're merging together, 'cause we had them, we had 'em. They were... they had to have been scared. They had to have been afraid. There was no way we were losing this challenge today; no way. And, um... we're going to... we're going to kill 'em. We're going to eat 'em up and spit 'em out, and that's the way Mike would want it to be. It was the last thing he said to us before he left, and it's exactly what we're going to do.\n",

And regardless of what happens, we need to eat 'em up and spit 'em out.\n",

We were going to lather them up and go pick them flowers, and now we're going to have to shift gears. They're nice, you know? They're nice guys. I knew they would be, but I get the feeling that Keith is, is an outsider. So far, they're exactly what I expected. They seem to have a good relationship together, which I didn't expect. I figured that, um, Keith would sort of be off on his own, and he could be, you know? They may be working us here, but... It was good chicken, and it was good to be able to provide them with chicken, 'cause they obviously had not been eating.\n",

We weren't together 15 minutes, and it started.\n",

      "When we started building the shelter, I thought everybody started chipping in, because there was the wood gatherers, and there was the people that were building, and, uh, I had worked a lot of, uh, you know, some construction in my life, and I-I had a reasonable sense of, uh, of-of construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we're starting to get to know each other, and people are not accustomed to this kind of lifestyle yet. I'm a little accustomed to this lifestyle, because I do hunt and I do fish and I do camp, so it's not that foreign to me. When I saw those figs, it was a big rush. And two or three people came over and helped pick the figs, and we brought 'em back, and, uh... I bit into one right off the tree.\n",

      "\n",
      "It was odd that in fact it not only wasn't appreciated, they didn't like it. I think people are starting to get a little bit edgy without food, and they don't realize how bad it's going to get. I'm a student of nutrition, and I know what this is doing to my body. But these other people have no idea. If they did, they would be out fishing and hunting for food. But they don't. I guess maybe the way that I can convince them of the importance of the food is by catching a lot of it and then feeling full one time and seeing what happens to their body and how much energy they have. Maybe that's how I can convince them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to bring food today. If I can keep providing food, I absolutely am sure I will make the merger. If I can't, I become vulnerable. I've been thinking a lot about the fact that at Tribal Council it came out that I was the leader, and I don't really want to be seen as the leader. So if I can get something, I'll lay real low on the other leadership areas and just be the food guy.\n",

      "Ultimately, this game is about the million dollars, but you need to take sm-small steps along the way to get there.

And so what I've had to use is twine, and twine, um, is not as great as fishing line-- it breaks, you have to weave it together to get through the hole. The fish can see it, obviously, and plus the twine floats, so I have to tie a rock to the twine to make the twine sink, which makes it even more noticeable to the fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I've been trying to fish every day, and I've been unsuccessful, but I'm not going to quit. I'm going to keep on doing it and doing it and doing it until I can find a great fishing spot or a technique that works.\n",

And that's-that's the one thing that makes me a little nervous about Frank and about Teresa is they could be so close to the final four if they side with Brandon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lex's vote, I think, just pushed the limits of our alliance. It kind of redefined how tight our bonds were. You know, he gave his word to Brandon, but he gave his word to us, also. Lex kind of went out on his own and covered his own ass.\n",

He makes fun of me 'cause I'm Jewish and I make fun of him 'cause he's fat and he's got a boil on his neck and there's just, like, competition, you know, he's going to beat me at checkers.\n",

      "When I walked around that bush and saw that big blue Chevy truck and knew it wasn't mine, I was... so, like, jealous. So I was annoyed and a little pissed off. And trying to be happy for Lex, but deep down inside, I wasn't that happy for him. It's tough, it's annoying. You know, I just-- I just don't want him to win anymore.\n",

      "I worked my butt off to get right here, and I go and I blow it on such a... a silly little mistake. And I just lost concentration. My back foot came off, and that's the killer. I can never ever get to that spot again. It feels horrible. It feels horrible.\n",

We can't afford to go down to five and lose three of them in a row. That's just unthinkable at this point.

So I've been pretty steadfast in trying to keep with my original alliance. I really have not faltered from that, and for-for me that's worked. At least it's gotten me this far.\n",

And I wish that nobody had to feel bad about it. That's the double-edged sword of winning this immunity. That I have to do, you know, something that will pain me and it will pain the person that I don't bring with me to the final two. There's nothing fun about that.\n",

I kind of figured that Clarence would vote for me, but when the second vote came in, I was pissed off. I was-- I was furious. The person that threw that vote at me and that now chooses to-to hide, torques me and it pisses me off that I can't figure it out and smoke him out right away.\n",

But the ride was so bumpy. I mean it was an absolute ball-buster.\n",

      "We kind of got attached to the goats on that three and a half hour trip. I thought maybe they were going to end up in a flock and they were going to be these happy goats that kind of, you know, cruise around the countryside eating grass and-and maybe mating or whatever. We saw him turn around with the two goats and he made a beeline, not twenty feet away from us straight into the butchery. Be that as it may, we had twenty-five bucks to spend.\n",

      "We were clearly a-a couple of things to see in that village. We had a-a constant kind of entourage that followed us around, many of which weren't even talking to us. They were just staring at us. Somebody from the village, obviously the guy that's in the know, or hooked up with everybody, immediately latched on to us and said, “I can take you to the best place in town.” We sat down, and asked for a menu. They didn't have a menu, um, but the guy basically told us, “Yeah, we have three things here.” The maize we didn't want anything to do with because that's the mush we're eating here. Meat we weren't feeling super safe about because we saw a lot of cats kind of milling around. We weren't quite sure what that meant. And then french fries sounded, I mean, right off the bat that sounded great.\n",

      "At this stage of the game, you don't want to piss anyone off. You know, we didn't want to go there and say, “Oh, it was the greatest thing ever and you guys didn't get to do it.” We wanted to be sensitive to the fact that it was probably tough for them to be left behind while we went off and had a really great time and ate a bunch of food when they were eating, you know, a tiny portion of mush.\n",

      "The last three days, since, uh, since our last Tribal Council, have been pretty interesting. There was that mystery-- that mystery vote, and my goal was in three days to figure out who it was that cast that vote. After putting two and two together, gathering a lot of information, kind of observing things, it became really evident that my worst fears were more and more likely than not were true.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mood in camp this morning is pretty grim. We had an emotion-packed, um, Tribal Council last night. The mood is heavy. There's definitely two kind of divisions here, you know-- people that voted for Lex; people that voted for Kelly; and we're waiting for the, uh, for the smoke and ash to settle before we can figure out kind of what's going on. But the biggest issue in the game right now is-is-is trust and who do you trust, and who do you believe, and, you know, that's-that's kind of the-- when you think about it in life, that's kind of the foundation that you base everything on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank just decided I'm going to be a jerk about this thing and-and it set the tone for probably the next three days. He-he approached me a few days ago and asked me to make an alliance with him, and I said, “You know I've got my alliances already set. I don't feel comfortable making an agreement with you.” I mean, I was fully straight up with him, and he's probably pissed off about the fact that I made some sort of agreement with Brandon, who happens to be public enemy number one to Frank. At this point now, I feel it's his time to go because I'm having a hard time dealing with that guy anymore. The guy has just become a-a pain in my butt, and just having him around brings morale down. The guy's always in a sour mood. It's just not good for tribe morale and I'm ready to get rid of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where does Brandon fit in now? That's what's become very complicated. Because Brandon helped save our skins. Brandon did us a favor. However, Tom and Ethan are not in agreement. They still don't trust him and they're actually talking about wanting to vote Brandon out next, which I have a hard time understanding. Um, I don't think I'm going to be able to do that. If- this is one situation where I may have to vote outside my fray.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Immunity Challenge feels very important to me, personally. I mean, I am- I am now in the most vulnerable position of anyone in-in our tribe. I have the most, as-as I know-- as far as I know, I've got the most votes against me. So I'm going to do everything I can to win immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been out here for 24, 25 days now. Um, I have a lot invested, and the longer you're out here, the more you want to got all the way. I mean, it has a strange way psychologically of working out that way. You just-- it becomes less and less an option to take that long walk, you know, out-out of the game. You wanna stay. I mean, the next couple days are going to be really difficult. We've got-- we've got to make a decision. Tom, Ethan, Kim and I have to make a decision about what we're going to do at Tribal Council, and how we're going to vote. I've already indicated to them that if they decide that Brandon's the mark, then I can't vote that way and they better be able to figure out a way to get extra votes, or else our coalition, our-our alliance is gonna- is gonna go down, and they're going to be able to pick us off one by one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom, Ethan, Kim and I are-are all still standing, and we've got an advantage now-- we've got everyone else outnumbered. But they knew that I was pretty close to Brandon-- he was a friend-- and that I'd have a really hard time voting for him, and I didn't vote for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been out here now for a month, it's just starting to catch up with us. Everybody's started to feel more lethargic, weaker, and it all... It's interesting because it all happened at the same time. And we felt comfortable admitting it because it was obvious that everyone was feeling the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our bodies are starting to show signs of trouble. We're starting to get sick. In the last couple, three days, we've all noticed that we're getting thinner. It's starting to really show.\n",
      "\n",
      "We eat two small meals a day. I figure we're having, I don't know, maybe a couple of hundred calories, if that. And we're eating, I think, just enough to fool our bodies into thinking that we're getting nutrition when we really aren't.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's just kind of a... just a watery gruel with some, you know, some corn kernels in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the food auction, you could definitely see alliance lines and relationship lines that apply to the game itself. I mean, Kim and I have been close since the get-go. Tom and Ethan have been very close too. T-Bird and Frank, no surprise there. They've really only got each other at this point. And also, it was kind of painfully obvious that Kim Powers is kind of on her own. But there are people taking care of her there. It was interesting to see who's a more clever and shrewd wheeler and dealer. Tom probably walked away the biggest winner as far as food.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, his whole, you know, “I'm a hayseed from Virginia, I'm not that smart.” I knew quickly that he was a lot brighter than he let on. And actually, I mean that endeared me to him and intrigued me all the more.\n",

      "Tom gets away with murder. Like today, you know, he was having a good time bathing the ladies, having them kind of pull their bathing suits back.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew when I picked Tom that it was going to be a roller coaster ride. If anyone should see something completely different and really experience Africa, I thought-- I thought Tom was really kind of deserving. The plane landed and we were whisked away to a place called Governor's Camp. If you can imagine the ultimate five-star luxury hotel just literally dropped right in the middle of a lush African jungle. That's what it was. It was just, it was like the Garden of Eden.\n",
      "\n",
      "The safari was amazing. I'm seeing just about every type of wildlife that I've wanted to see, and I'm seeing it all in the-- in the space of an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both Tom and I like to-- like to tip a cocktail back now and again at home. And so our first thought coming back was I'd-I'd kill somebody to get a nice cold beer in me. And this place is wonderful because if you want something, there is somebody right there. They can almost read your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the dinner bell rang, Tom wasn't quite done with his bottle of bourbon. Tom is definitely not one to, uh, waste anything, so he took his bottle with. (laughs) In fact, it was in his pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got back from dinner, Tom decided to promptly help himself to as much of the bourbon as possible. I know he was-- he was liquored and loaded, but (chuckles) it just made-made the whole night that much funnier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was spent. So I-I kind of-- I took him to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm looking straight down into the jungle looking straight on overhead on-on wildlife. We are just whisking through this stuff, you know, and while the sun is coming up. It was... it was amazing. It was-- leaves you breathless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going back to camp at this point is going to be miserable. I mean, I'm feeling sick about it. Going back to camp now means going back to the game. I'm going to be the last person standing, so, in the next couple of hours, I'll have to be on my game again, as much as it pains me to-to admit it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T-Bird's got-- she's got a lot of fire in her belly. And I know that there's nothing more dangerous than a desperate animal-- an animal or a person that wants something bad enough that they're willing to just try anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought it was going to be this hard, physically, mentally, psychologically, emotionally. And now that we're so close to the end, I'm exhausted. But up until just the last few days, um, I've really tried hard not to think about my kids and my wife. But I can't allow myself to give into any of that until I'm finished. You can't afford, out here, to be a sissy. It has been pretty funny that we take our drinking water, basically out of an elephant's toilet.\n",
      "\n",
      "You gotta drink and you gotta pull your water and you got-- you gotta wash, but God, holy mackerel, that-that elephant, he couldn't have picked a better spot to, uh, to relieve himself in. It looked like he hadn't done his business in a couple of weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "This stage of the game, boredom is something that has definitely become a reality. Plus, I mean, frankly, we've been out here 35 days. We're running out of things to talk about and things to do. I've probably gotten to know the four other people that are left here better than some people that I've known for five, ten years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to Tree Mail, expecting that it was going to be challenge time. This was a-a completely different kind of Tree Mail, because we opened up the mailbox and it was-- it was an instant reward.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had letters from my wife, from my two sons, from my mother, my father. It doesn't get any better than that. It gave me what I need to get through the next few days. It fed my body and my soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I won the truck, Jeff explained to me, kind of, what the visit part of the reward was, and it was actually visiting a hospital in-- in a-- in a village here in Kenya, uh, called Wamba. And our visit was going to be to deliver a-a year's worth of supplies, especially for all of their AIDS testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a little hospital, in this little village, in the middle of Kenya. People come from all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "This old Italian gentleman, this doctor, has dedicated his entire lifetime to helping people here in Africa. This guy does it simply out of the goodness of his own heart and has single-handedly mobilized and inspired enough people to create a-a completely self-sufficient hospital in the middle of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are delivering all these medical supplies that they're in desperate need of. I mean, they're-they're running on fumes at that hospital as it is, and we are also going to provide them with a new drug that allows pregnant women who have H.I.V. to have children, and the children have a better than 50% chance of being born without H.I.V. Whereas, if they didn't get this medication, they would probably be born H.I.V. positive. We got a tour of the pediatric ward, which was both heart-breaking and just inspirational. You've got these-these little kids, almost all of them orphans. I got to actually pass out toys, which, you know, is always a good time. I got to play with these kids. Uh, they made me miss the hell out of my kids. We walk out of there, after spending a day checking out the hospital, talking to the doctors, seeing all of this stuff face-to-face, I walked away a changed person.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gift I take away from here is he's planted a small seed in me and I'm-I'm gonna take that home with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was gone most of the day. When I got back, the vibe was thick at camp. Everyone else in the tribe was bummed about the fact that they lost and didn't win. Everyone was nervous, and no one really wanted to talk about anything. There was some strange stuff going down. The mojo was just funky.\n",
      "\n",
      "T-Bird approached me before Tribal Council and obviously needed to have a heart-to-heart. She is the odd person out at this point. She's the only person that's left that's from the original Samburu. Um, she's in a mess of hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "T-Bird is obviously struggling with-with something, and-and so she said, you know, “I need you to sit down and I have something I need to confess to you. I have something before we go to Tribal Council I need to tell you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she said, you know, “When you got that one mystery vote,” who at the time I thought might be Kelly, “I was the one that cast that vote for you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, “Well, there's not more than a couple people that it could be because you're telling me to watch my back.” And she just looked at me and, you know, went like this... (nods) In telling her that, Tom is basically giving her a green light that I was the right person to vote for. And I also found out, you know, at that point, Mama Cat told me that she had also been approached by Tom on more than one occasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, I'm responsible for myself and nobody else. It's completely gone to cutthroat mode. And if I think that Tom, if I think that he's in a situation where he is about to screw me over and stab me in the back, I'll cut his throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're in the homestretch, and emotions are just all over the map. I mean, this game goes over a 39-day period, and the whole thing is like a giant puzzle. And sometimes when one person says something to you, like what T-Bird said to me before Tribal Council, all of a sudden some of the loose puzzle pieces, you find the spot that they fit in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mama Cat had been approached a couple of times by Tom, who had told her, you know, “If you happen to vote for Lex in any of these Tribal Councils,” um, “that's totally okay by me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The four of us left are all probably more surprised than the next about the fact that we're still here. And I couldn't have imagined it being as crazy as it is. It's good, it's bad, it's bitter, it's sweet. But more now than ever, our brains are focused on, well, “Is there anyone trying to burn me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that there's a really good chance that Tom had pulled a bit of treachery when it came to him and me, and what I need to do is confront Tom with it and just find out was it true, was he going to fess up to it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom and I, you know, there have been a couple of situations in the past that have arisen that we haven't quite seen eye-to-eye on. And I guess Tom had the impression that I wasn't really working quite with him or for him, but against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't forget about what Tom has done for me in the past. We could thank each other equally for still being here. So I would not feel right about cutting him off at the knees because on a couple of occasions he's fallen from grace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last night and this morning, there were some tough and trying times, so we decided to take some time and go up to Bull Rocks and just sort of Zen-out for a while. When you go up to Bull Rocks, it's so peaceful, and we can also get, you know, a look down at our boma, which kind of gives you a different perspective on things, and you just can't help but think about stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Playing the game for me, at this point, has become all about winning. Damn it, I am going to walk away with that prize. I am here for one thing and one thing only, to take that million dollars, and to run with it, it's mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think Kim has got the best chance at winning this challenge. She's got a really good mind for facts, she's got really good retention, and she takes a genuine interest in everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was up pretty much all night, um, with, uh, with just diarrhea that I was cramping up pretty bad this morning, couldn't really hold down water. It's just one of those things. The game of Survivor never takes a time-out. It's the real deal. You come out here for 39 Days and if, at any point during those 39 Days, you're not 100% on your game or something happens to you, that's just tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, what will be weighing heavy on our minds and on our hearts today is wondering which one of us is, uh, out of the game tonight and which one of us is going to be here until the very end, until the final two. Only one of us can stay, and that's all up to Mama Cat.\n",

      "\n",
      "We get back to camp, Clarence comes to meet us 20 yards from camp. Right then, I smelled a little something. He didn't smell good. So when we got on that trail I sniffed a little bit more. Through talking to Diane, she admits that she give Clarence some water and they just ate a can of beans.\n",
      "\n",
      "We almost went too long without water. I mean, your body just can't take it. A couple people, it's been a week, and there ain't nothing we can do about that. We got two freeloaders. It hurts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our camp is kind of amazed right now because we got to make big decisions. Every time we've been in a big situation, we falter, and that's not okay.\n",
      "\n",

      "We got a black man with white tighties on, we got a big fat man with a flag waving, we got two little skinny men with flags running around, women in her thong there. We got a young lady shakin' and bakin' up there, so I don't know what else we could do. If that won't stop a plane, I want to talk to the pilot.\n",

      "Well, grits is a nice thought for this stuff. But going down the hatch, it reminds you more of something that rhymes with grits. But basically, no grits. We've got to find a little something we can munch on.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, after that, we've hammered ourselves to death trying to get the doggone thing open. Trying for over 30 minutes and getting tubed, then taking 20 minutes to open one. We had something about the size of your thumb now that you could eat. In my opinion, it ain't worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Jeff said, “Give me your buff,” I almost turned around and bolted. I would've... if he... you know, and ran. It's a long way back to camp, but if he'd give me the option-- run all the way back to camp, no water for two days, or give me your buff, I'd still be trying to run.\n",

You're washing in that-- washing your clothes, washing your face, washing your hind end.” She has yet to understand that, and I've quit telling her. And I let her wash in it every day.

And so I walked over to her and she was crying and she looked like she was in some serious pain. Her dehydration state today and working really hard got her really sick, really fast. She had some severe pain in her kidneys and in her stomach. So I sat with her for quite a while, trying to get her to drink, but she kept spitting it up.\n",

      "I cannot be any more excited about the fact that we got food unless it was water. I'd give it all up for water. One of the big focuses in our group is water, obviously. We have to go get the water. We have to boil the water. Frank and Doc were the two people who took that under their wing. They were kind of the water people, getting the water going. And our group was going-- they're doing all the work. Fine with that. So we won't do any of it.

You know, it was-- it was definitely annoying to see, um, Silas and Frank were really, like, blocking us from getting into the, um, little corals. It was frustrating just because it's, like, Silas, you know, it's somebody we were working together with and now he's working against you, so it was very frustrating.\n",

      "They're basically saying “Align with us, we'll take you further,” and I'm just not going to do it. I'm not comfortable with it. I know Brandon wouldn't do it to me. He wouldn't do it to me, no matter what.\n",

      "\n",
      "Kelly said she wasn't going to vote for Lex, but I think there's part of her that does want to vote with us because she doesn't want Lex to be around. Everything lays on the next Immunity Challenge. I mean, if Lex wins, it's kind of back to game over for us. So everything lays on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so shocking to me because I've trusted Brandon for 24 straight days. He's been my friend, so I thought. And I thought what he said was you know, going to be true, and-and, I'm really burnt up today for sure. I mean, I-I can't understand it.\n",

      "Depending on who wins immunity, it's gonna put a whole spin on this game and it will be very interesting to see who gets voted off next. Um, I mean, it could very well be me. And a lot of people want to vote Brandon off. Um, I know Teresa still thinks that we might be able to vote Lex out. So it's going to be very interesting and whoever wins immunity, it will be hugely important this time. I mean it always is, but this is like another really crucial, crucial move to win immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the last Tribal Council, we voted off Brandon, and, uh, you know, we had been pals since our early days in Samburu. But you know, I felt very betrayed by him from the previous Tribal Council and I didn't trust him any longer, so I had to vote him out. I guess it's all part of the game, but it-it still tugged at my heart a little bit.\n",

You need to be a little bit bitchy, so that they'll have another choice besides Lindsey, because we're both screwed if they do that.” When you have to think of everything, and then all they do is cry and whine and moan and bitch and complain all the time, I'm just like... it-it's-- it's such a great thing that I'm gay 'cause I could not stand to put up with a crying woman now.

So I got up this morning with a little rumbling in my stomach. And so I took my shovel out into the bush to do my business. By the time I got done, I looked up and there were, uh, a nice little herd of elephant north of me, and I had no idea. You forget that, sometimes, that you're-you're in Africa, because we've been here so long, and today I kind of was lax on my security, not paying attention, because my stomach was rumbling a little bit. While I was doing my business, I could have got trampled. It would have been a really... a really embarrassing way to die. (laughs)\n",
      "\n",
      "We don't know what's going on right now. Uh, today we thought this would be merger day with the other tribe, but so far we're just pretty much hanging out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tribe Moto Maji is up and running, and it starts with our flag, so I've got a big job ahead of me. So... I've got to make sure I finish it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing that Survivor flag, it's just not real until you're here. And seeing that flag, everyone just wanted to pass out, of course. You know, then Frank was all yelling at us to pick up the pace now that we saw the flag. And we're just dragging ourselves to get there, so...\n",
      "\n",
      "The water is disgusting-- I'm terrified. It's sick-- I mean, I was filling it up, and I... it was so... (shows small distance with fingers) it was... is this deep. So all you get water mixed with crud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kim and somebody, I think Linda, just decided to open the medical kit to see what was in there, and you know, tampons and, you know, stuff that we need, and in the medical kit there just happened to be a-a telescope for us to, you know, watch out for animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comfort level sleeping is definitely something that we could use a little bit more of. I don't think one person has gotten a good night's sleep since we've been here, so that's tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank is a really interesting character, but really for the military, you know, he-he barks orders and he-he just wants things to be done, kind of right now, his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's never a moment when someone is not trying to whisper something in someone's ear. I mean, it's insane. Sitting around, watching groups of people kind of whispering off to the side, you know, you get that little anxiety built up inside you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silas came back from the watering hole and I felt just that little bit of apprehension and I just got kind of curious 'cause I'm thinking, hmm... I-I just want to know what's going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's when the game really became real to me, you know? I thought I was out here on a camping trip, just having a good time with a bunch of friends, and to be honest, I don't think I trust anybody now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a lot riding on Silas, and honestly, I have no other choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The older group seems a little bit nervous. Basically, we kind of feel like they're sucking up to us a little bit, so yeah, I mean, if they'll go get the water and we don't need to help, why not? We want to save our strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Brandon was cooking, he said that we should have first dibs and we should pig out and eat as much as we can and leave them whatever is left. I mean, if they want more, they can make more, you know, I mean, that's-that's fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of my best friends made me a necklace and each bead is someone who's close to me, and my necklace broke, so Kim and I were sitting around trying to fix it. And I said, “Well, now that, you know, we're a foursome, I think each of you need to have a bead on my necklace.” So I said, “Hey, there's an idea. I'll give you each your bead and we'll have these necklaces that represent that we're one unit, like little kids in fifth grade.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, the four of us would like to possibly see an older person have a little weak moment in-in the competition so they can all open their eyes, because they keep coming down saying the weak people need to go. Just stick with me and we'll weed the weak ones out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what happened yesterday was, I was dehydrated and when you're dehydrated, every other problem area of your body is exacerbated. So, my kidneys were sore, my stomach was sore-- I'm still a little bit groggy and a little weak, but I'm going to be really cognizant of my water intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still here, and I'm smiling big.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time I got back to camp, I felt really angry. Just, like, it all hit me. Just like, “Oh, my God, they picked me?! Those bastards!” You know? And I just got really angry, and I just wanted to lash out and just be mad at those three people for voting for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tried to sleep in, and we got-- we were awakened. And now we're struggling to-to get our bearings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just everything sort of hit me this morning, and I just started to cry because I felt just... I felt sectioned out of my little group even though they're totally supportive of me. I felt like the older group picked me. And how can I face them again? And I just felt sad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never thought I'd say, “Vote for me three times tonight. Come on!” But it-it'll help us. It'll help us in the end as long as I don't get voted for, you know, once the merger happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "When they arrived, I was excited at first. I was like, “Oh, sweet, other team members are here. What's going on?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then as reality set in... we all kind of just panicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "You think you're on top one minute, and then we just had this incredible loop thrown towards us, and, you know... just this kink in the loop that just threw everything off, all confidence completely down the drain.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's no stability out here. It's just, like, walking on eggshells every second, and... it just gets frustrating. It's-it's really draining, I mean, we're hungry, we're tired, you know, we just had this new team appear and we're all stressed out, and I'm just emotional over it all, you know? I've made these great new friends, and I'm so excited to leave with this experience because it's awesome, but I'm not ready to leave yet and I'm terrified. I don't want to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone is stressed out right now. This whole switcheroo thing has made everyone's mind kind of go crazy. Everyone is thinking, “Oh, we're two new tribes now. Let's not think of our old tribes.” But it's inevitable, you're going to think of your old tribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we have a tie, it comes down to who has more votes, and I already have four votes against me, so I'd be gone. I'm really trying to save my own butt, you know? I-I don't want them to have any clue about my situation. I mean, I set a goal for myself, and I am the kind of person that when I set a goal, I'm going to achieve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food reward was amazing, I mean, we just pigged out. And our stomachs, you know, they've shrunk, so it's-it's hard to-to stuff food in there and let them expand, but we sure found a way. Kim gorged on stuff her body wasn't used to, and her tiny little, you know, five foot one figure isn't going to hold all that very well. So she was pretty close to vomiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I saw that Silas was gone, my heart sank. I was definitely shocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we had the upper hand, we treated Frank and Teresa poorly. Especially me, I-I gloated, and I was excited and I felt like I was the queen of the land, which was a bad move on my part. And I think they were definitely out for some kind of revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've have some moments with Kelly that I feel like we've sort of bonded and we've had a good time, and she has expressed that she's fearful of-of her demise, so... she seems pretty genuine.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were trying to tell them something. I don't know if it was, you know, vote for Lindsey, she has votes, or... I-I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're totally confident that if it's a three and three tie against Brandon and Tom, that Brandon can win the questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, we made a pact with Brandon in the beginning of this game, but he screwed me over by letting them overhear that I have votes, so I was... I was upset. So right now, I feel like this is a selfish game and I'm in it for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just thought, “Oh, my God, if this can secure them not voting for me, I'll do it.” And this isn't cheating. I'm not sticking a card up my sleeve. This is just making the right move for myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm kind of in a no-win situation. I mean, do I go against my personal morals and values and vote against Brandon? Or do I vote with Brandon and Kim and risk being the next one voted out of here? I don't know what I'm going to do, and I don't think I'll know until I get to Tribal Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's the fourth day of the game, and, uh, things are starting to heat up a little bit. I think everybody kind of realizes the seriousness of the game. So, you know, what-what's being said and what's being done are just totally different things.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, sometimes you can't be a nice guy. I mean, we're all here to win. And, uh, you know, the nice guy finishes last, and that's a fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's like this double face thing you have to play while you're out here. It's funny, I mean, we're here to win a million dollars. So, I'm going to do what it takes to win. I don't know, it's interesting. Things are changing all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The younger people, I think we've realized that if we don't stick together, we're going to lose this, we- they're going to pick us off. And, uh, I'm not going out that way. And straddling the fence is over, period, it's done. I am no longer with the older people and I- and I don't care if they know that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying to get under everyone's skin, I'm trying to expose everybody the best I can, you know, Doc, getting out all his... all his valuables and all his money and his Porsche.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the older people to see her down was just like a thumb up on their side-- it was just a, you know, shakes hands, a smile and a cheerio, you know, “Hey they got one down, we're stronger.” I hated for them to get that little sweet flavor of victory in their mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we had our first Tribal Council. We voted Doc off. All eight of us went in there split four and four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anything could have happened. And it was, literally, a crap shoot. Whoever won, uh... won that Tribal Council basically won the majority and basically more or less took over the tribe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing about Lindsey, of course she handled it wrong. We needed their support and we needed to be kind to them. But boy, she really just kind of flew off, you know, the-the deep end.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning was a little tense, but we really pulled together today. And we won some food. And all in all, it was an unbelievable victory today. So it boosted up morale, boosted spirits. It boosted everything, confidence-- it was a good thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basket we won was just amazing. We-we won soup mix, you know, rice. We won, like, jelly to put on stuff. I mean, it's flavor for the food that we have. And that's key.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you ever go into Tribal Council with a tie, like myself and someone else, the tie-breaker is who has the most votes is out.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's not an event in-in the future that would alarm me. I can't wait til the merge because I-I plan on winning this. You might as well write the check and hand it to me because I'm shooting for the stars. And-and I'm going to get there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, they definitely set up mine, up Silas, and A.K.A. Um, they weren't here to play the game last night, you know, they were there for revenge for them to show, “Ah, kiss my ass,” you know, “We-we have the power. Look at this, we're going to screw you.” And, you know, again, it just shows the older group's maturity level, and again, it's a game and-and, you know, no big deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "My old tribe, I, uh, had an alliance with four of the young people. Now as far as the situation, you know, yeah, it's not that great. I mean, I came here with the two people that I didn't probably want to come here with, and you know, left three of my buddies back at the other camp, and that was kind of tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm definitely on the other side right now. I was on the good side, now I'm on the bad side. This twist in the game has really stuck a thorn in my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frank and T, this is like, rejuvenated their life. I mean, this is like a new-- whole new opportunity for them, you know, because they knew at least one of them was going to go the next vote.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went to get wood with Ethan and, uh, just kind of wanted to pick his brain, and he said he wanted to get rid of Clarence, and I think he has some ill feelings towards Clarence and I know Kim does too, and, hopefully, those are strong enough to convince T and Frank, and vote for him and then he'll go off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm dying to see what's going to happen. It's tough, but I definitely know it's going to be probably myself or Clarence. It's going to be a good Tribal Council tonight.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is really the mother continent for me. I don't know if this makes any sense, but Mother Africa, and I've been here before, I have tremendous respect. And when the tribe was joking about tamborunos or, you know, the tampons in Samburu, my reaction to that, inside I was thinking, “Oh, my God. That is so disrespectful. The Samburu people, you know, civilization, ages and ages ago. Do you realize where you... where you are? This is where it all started, folks, in Africa.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I get this funny feeling that I'm probably the last person she wanted to maybe stumble upon her. One of the things that Lindsey likes to say every day on a regular basis is how strong she is. She's the strongest person that she knows. Guess she's not so strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult hearing comments when they came back, like Lindsey was saying, “They (expletive censor) with the wrong girl!” And comments like, “Okay, so come here, team,” and they really meant the four of them. It was no accident because I was standing right there where Silas was over by the fire and they got him. And I thought, “Oh, God, (slaps face) that's mean!”\n",
      "\n",
      "When Frank and I got mail this morning, I was loving it. Oh, yeah, that was great. I thought, if anything, that'll drill in that you can't just sleep late. Our water is low. Now, we don't have time to get to the water hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silas with the knee? I've seen him on the knee twice. And-and-and-- and I looked at that. And I guess, I don't know, that's like a football thing where the coach gets down and just whatever. Maybe it's genuine. It seemed so cheesy to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were saying, “Oh, it's just because anger.” And like, “Oh, let it go.” I'm like, “Okay, great. Let it go. Let's hug.” And her arms went like this! And she-she got that look in her eyes, like-like, I don't know, I had a knife in my hand or she was going to-- I don't know. It was-- it was-- it was awfully strange.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, Frank's birthday. I got up, gave him a birthday hug, and he was whittling on his torch, and he was carving his children and his wife's name. I thought that was just beautiful.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's obviously D-Day. Um, we go to Tribal Council this evening. We know it's either going to be myself, T, or Frank that's going to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not want to see Silas win the million dollars. I can see any of the other three win the million dollars. I don't want him winning the million dollars. I don't trust him at all. There's something-- there's something off there. I'm not even sure of his name. There's just something not quite right.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been working my buns off. Frank's been working our buns off, and we're always thinking the next step ahead because other people don't do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not out there trying to get anybody hurt, but they have to understand. They know what they signed up. If they thought they signed up to go to the YMCA and roast marshmallows, and maybe win a million dollars, they're wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see a strong foursome here, you see a weak threesome here. Where you going to put yourself? He would be a complete fool and an idiot not to stay with the tight four.\n",
      "\n",
      "Silas is on our team all the way. He'll play the other people too because he's going to go where he feels is the power. But he's going to join us. Now, do I trust him? Hell, no!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I went to get the water, because if I don't get up, it's not going to get done. You think anybody else gets off their ass to do anything? I'm starting to wonder here, I'm like, look, I'm the old guy, okay, but I know what needs to be done-- every morning, fire, water and food.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problem we have is we got two cracks in the water tubs. They're putting on damn beads on a necklace. Generation X.\n",
      "\n",
      "They're immature, they're trying to get under our skin, and its working.\n",
      "\n",
      "I drive a Porsche, pardon me, you know what I mean? Silas brings it up as a negative, “Oh, look at the doc, he drives this, he drives that.” He's trying to plant seeds to Kim, Brandon and Lindsey. It's not going to work. All it does is shows his lack of maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "He wants to learn wisdom, he's not learning it that way. You can't create a work ethic when they've never had a work ethic. This is Generation X. This is definitely Generation X. I'm glad I'm 46 years old and I'm glad I'm not part of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think anybody, unless they've been put in a situation like this, really know how much water your body really needs. I mean, I really need water right now. I really do-- I'm so dehydrated. It's... I'm hurting right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's very nervous. He was shaking. He came up to me, and, like, was looking for my approval on how I felt about him and what he had done, and it felt like he needed me to tell him that it was going to be okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know why I'm shaking. I don't- I don't know if it's because of lack of water or because I'm cold. And I'm probably the only one that hasn't had any water. It's just very bad. It's just... it's like tar. I have to drink it. I have to drink. God, I never thought drinking water would be so hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guys are being really good, you know? They said it's okay. I mean, I don't know at this point. I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "I carry mail, so I just kind of went at my pace, which is probably faster than most people. And I got way out there and then ended up having to wait.\n",
