Caleb and Tai could get back together and put a big target on their back, and so all of a sudden, maybe I'm not the most obvious target.\", \"We lost the challenge. Like, the unthinkable occurred. So a miracle will happen if I'm to be here tomorrow. I'm feeling like two against four and Caleb's a freakin' powerhouse, so immediately I know I'm in hot water.\", \"Caleb going home last night instead of me was a break in this game. I know that Debbie and Tai do have a complicated relationship, so I'm trying to show Debbie that I am your asset going forward, and Tai is a liability.\", \"Oh, my gosh. All of a sudden, oh, look, how the tables have turned. I mean, I have options. I could go with this tribe, but I could also flip. There's so many different dynamics going on that you need to consider your short-term and long-term game at the same time in this vote.\", \"So Debbie's explosion about Brad centered on-on her not being heard in the challenges. I don't really see the argument. I think Brad is great in challenges. He's a leader. He pulls people together. But she thinks that I'm the princess, I get whatever I want, and she's the ghoul that gets nothing. (light chuckle)\", 'Little Debbie got loose. She was shaking it all over the place. I think alcohol was an excuse for Debbie to go “Debbie” on us.', 'Going into a merge, it’s just like… (simulates explosion) people are everywhere. There’s pockets of conversation everywhere and you can’t keep track of-- of who is all talking. There’s not a lot of people that I feel like are working with me at this point in the game. Seems like Michaela is on the chopping block, but I want to work with Michaela. I think that she’s a great person, but she’s also a good number for me right now. So I just need to kind of lit a fire under Michaela’s butt to start getting some strategy on that’s going to help me.', 'Everyone’s just saying Zeke, so I’m going to put Zeke’s name down because what else do I have right now? But I’m not comfortable.']), 'Aubry': (5, ['Michaela is definitely a tricky one for us as a tribe. She has a bit of a hot streak, and if you ignite that the wrong way, the whole place is burning down.', \"I talked to Tony this morning. He's a threat in the game. So am I. And I want to play with people who are threats, because I think that's the best thing for me right now.\", 'This twist is so dangerous to everyone because any fracture in any relationship is a reason to send somebody home tonight. This Tribal is going to be insane.', \"So we lost the Immunity Challenge. The Fijian gods are not loving Nuka right now… Nuku… whatever it is… I don't even know the name of this tribe. Like, that's the point that we're at. And I feel like Michaela has to be the next person to go. And for JT, we came into his camp. He's done his job. He's been a part of us.\", \"I went into Tribal thinking Michaela was going to go home, and they voted out JT I'm constantly on the bottom, and I feel like I've been trying really hard to build relationships with those people, but then it all blows up in my face.\", \"Clearly, Sandra is running the show.

More respect for Zeke in telling his story than I do for a handful of these jokers in knowing them for 20 days. And I think Zeke is right, the experience of going on Survivor, it makes you tough. And nothing is gonna be easy about the merge. There are thirteen people at this camp, and now the game at hand is figure out where people stand and who’s in the loop and who’s out of it.', 'I feel, right now, like I am in the middle of a big Italian family brawl. There are two sides, and Cirie, she’s like my black Italian grandma or aunt-- she’s more like an aunt. And if I’m going to be on Team Cirie, that’s fine with me.', 'Debbie reminds me now as she did around the time I voted her out of Survivor: Kaôh Rong. She starts to get cocky and then makes mistakes.', 'Coming back from the reward, I feel so lucky. It felt like Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. It was awesome. However, I’m a little bit concerned about the fact that I feel like Brad and Zeke had time to bond with each other. So I think we need to kind of think very carefully about… who we want to take out in the next vote.', 'Zeke’s a really smart player. Zeke is obviously calculating things many moves down the line. And something you have to do in Survivor is you always have to strike before the other person.', 'I won immunity! Aww! That felt really, really good to have a high moment in a 33-day journey where I needed something to kind of start a résumé. Now I’m thinking a couple of steps ahead, and Troyzan is someone who is likable, but Brad is physically a big threat, so the time is nigh for Brad Culpepper.', 'Luckily, I have a little solace tonight. It’s really weird to have this feeling. I feel like I can see things a little more clearly. I am not acting on that gut feeling with Sarah, because I fully believe it’s time to send Brad home.', '(tearfully) Pretty standard day for me in Survivor: up and down. Really feel great at the Immunity Challenge winning -- never happened before -- and I had a good relationship with Andrea. So naturally, she’s going to get killed off, too. Just my pattern in Survivor seems to be really high highs and really low lows.', 'I think Tai has been drinking the Kool-Aid that he needs to make a move in this game, but if I want to make a big move for my résumé, if I don’t get Tai out of here before he gets me out of here, my game is over anyway.', 'Once again, I feel like my life in the game is in Tai’s hands, which kind of sucks, because 10 minutes before Tribal, he’s having an emotional breakdown.', 'Brad smoked us all, and the tough part is Brad doesn’t seem to really want to work with me. So I feel like I could be going home. So I’m going to make a pitch to save myself, but I need the numbers right now.', 'If Brad wins the Immunity Challenge tomorrow, he will be taking Troyzan to the finale with him. Then Sarah and Tai each have a 50% shot at vying for that final spot. If, however, we make a move tonight together to take out Troyzan, that leaves two spots open.']), 'JT': (16, [\"Tai and myself, both of us love animals, no doubt about it. I mean, I'm a country boy from Alabama. But I'm looking out for me and myself, and Tai seems to be looking out for the chickens. I think the chickens inevitably are gonna hurt Tai. In this level of competition in this game, everything you do is critiqued. Anything can be a reason for someone to get rid of you. He's got to decide what he's here to do, win a million dollars or-or marry these chickens.\", 'I feel like the Survivor gods really let me down in this moment. Five to one is about as bad as I can hope for. I mean, in all likelihood I\\'m a sitting duck. So the only thing in this point that can save me would be the Hidden Immunity Idol. So I\\'ve got to do everything I can to stir things up here. In the back of my mind, I\\'d be already thinking, \"If I can get them out there in the ocean, I can get back to camp and start looking for an idol.\"', \"I get everyone on the raft, I drag 'em out to sea a good half mile, and, uh, we snorkel a little bit. Get 'em started fishing. And, uh, finally that opportunity presents itself when Malcolm bends the spear.\", 'So I say, \"Hey, Malcolm, you know what? I\\'ll go back and get the pliers. Y\\'all just enjoy this good time out here on the ocean. I\\'ll be right back.\"', \"I came to get the pliers. I know I gotta be back soon. Just figure I'll take every second I've got and look. Uh, idols could be anywhere. I'm looking in every nook, in every tree, every corner, every spot, every hole in a tree, up in the trees. It could be under rocks. It could be anywhere.\", \"I'm just frantically looking everywhere. It's never over til it's over. And I'm not giving up… everybody knows that. And they probably know I'm looking for an idol right now, but I took 'em as far out in the ocean as I could, and I left the pliers on purpose. So my job is to just keep looking. That's all I can do.\", 'Sandra\\'s-- she\\'s mentioned a couple of times she\\'d love to have the goats. She\\'s starving to death. \"Man, we could eat so much goat.\" I said, \"Yeah, that\\'d be great, you know? You know, I could probably catch one for you, you know?\"', \"I don't really want to catch and eat a goat, but first thing I need to do is keep myself safe, and if I can feed Sandra and make her happy, then, uh, I think Sandra will probably love me to death, and that will probably keep me safer in this game.\", \"I didn't really expect to catch a goat this quick, but I'm not a savage beast, and there's no way I'm going to kill that mama goat and her baby. I just can't do it. Sandra wants to eat a goat and she's running the show, but, you know, I'd rather let these goats go and let's see if we can catch another random goat that's not a mama or a baby. So I'm going to try my best to save the goat.\", \"The longer Sandra's in this game, the more trouble we're gonna have getting rid of her. She's a two-time winner for more than one reason. And you can tell by the attitude, the sass in Sandra's voice, she knows she's in charge. Malcolm and I definitely hit it off. We're both hard competitors, so Malcolm's excited. I can see it. Yeah, he wants to play with me. And I don't plan on losing, but if we lose an Immunity Challenge, bing bang boom, I can go ahead and make my move like I need to do here and get rid of Sandra.\", 'The most trustworthy relationship I have on the Mana tribe is Brad Culpepper. If I was a betting man, Brad is over there now saying, \"All our votes are going to Sandra.\" I could be a swing vote and vote Sandra, but that\\'s a big risk. I could just simply go with majority and vote Sierra or Tai-- Hmmm… But, you know, I\\'d much rather see Sandra go. If I wanted to, I could definitely change… change the course of this game big time.', 'Tribal Council tonight went about as bad as it could have for me. I told Brad Sierra was in trouble and to play the idol if he had it. I thought it was an easy opportunity to get rid of Sandra. Unfortunately, they voted out our strongest player, Malcolm. Malcolm was my closest friend on this tribe, so I gotta smooth it over here at camp as best I can and, uh, move forward.', \"They can't really prove what I said, so I'm going to defend myself 100%. Take it to my grave, because I'm here to win a million dollars.\", \"Tribal Council was really tough for me. My biggest fear right now is, you know, if we lose an Immunity Challenge, I should be the one to go. So I've got to get my hands on an idol. You know, as much as a I hate it, that's the truth.\", 'Lo and behold, I found a clue, and it says, \"To find your safety requires intersecting landmarks around your beach. Search casually, or in desperation, your protection is in reach.\" That\\'s great news. I\\'ve seen the trees with marks on \\'em, so with everyone away from camp, a couple of minutes, I\\'ll have it.', \"Lo and behold, I found the idol and no one knows, which was perfect. That's what I need. I'll never tell a soul, and that idol will keep me in this game.\", \"Michaela's starting to kind of lose her bearings out here. She's a little out there already, unstable. Yesterday the challenge was a little bit hard for me to handle. You know, no one wants to babysit out here when we're trying to survive. And today she wants seven drips of coffee and a spoonful of sugar. That blows my mind.\", \"I can't think of not one reason why anyone would want to keep Michaela in this game versus running with me.\", \"If I have to use my idol, I will, but they need me to win challenges.

Day 1, paranoia, stirring up trouble. All I can say is that's just Tony for ya.

It might be a bloodbath later, but for now we gotta win.', \"Tony was right. Sandra's convinced everybody that Tony should go. And now, they're trying to get me to be part of it, but I don't want to do that, because when it comes to strong people, when you get rid of one, it exposes the others. You send Tony home, it's exposing me and Malcolm. But looking at numbers on who will vote out Sandra, we've only got four, so we need one more person.\", \"So Tony throws out let's try to flip Michaela and it might just work, because one thing about Michaela, she just hates to lose, so maybe she'll be down with getting rid of the weakest link.\", \"Tai and I are back together again. It-- it's a great feeling because we just had-- have a really good, uh, close friendship, and I hope that we can continue what we had before.\", \"I got my head kind of down because I just hate to lose, and today's the ninth day, which I left last time.

I didn't start the blindside for Ozzy-- I participated-- in Fans vs. Favorites, but that was, like, eight years ago or something. I mean, get over it.\", 'It felt like we were solid, so maybe everybody will remain calm.', \"So just hearing the way Ozzy is feeling about me, I know that it's going to take something more than just the conversations we had. Listen, the war is going to start anyway. What difference does it make if the war starts tonight or tomorrow? There will be blood either way.\", \"I know Ozzy is coming for me, and I see that Ozzy and JT seem super tight, which is not good for me. My whole life right now is hanging on, like, by a string in this game. I think they think Cirie, the legend-jedi-mind-trick-puppet-master, is trying to get me. That might be so… (laughs) it's just not right now. (laughs) So I have to try to weed out who I can play with and who I can't. I have to get in with somebody. I can't play by myself.\", \"I wasn't on the right side of the numbers in the old Nuku tribe, and I think Ozzy is still a little skittish of me, but I'm trying to cultivate a relationship with him, so I need to take advantage of this new start. I'm hoping that'll help me later on down the line.\", \"We thought we had it, but then Troyzan dropped the ball. He was terrible… (chuckles) He already was the odd man out, and now Troyzan's life is hanging on, like, by a string.\", \"The pizza would have made a world of difference. I mean, I'm from Jersey, I'm as tough as they come, but certain things you break down. It's been 17 days and you-- it's rough. It's taxing on you physically, emotionally. So we don't know what to do.\", 'We walk into the challenge, and there’s a buffet on the table. So I’m like, “Oh, wow, it is a merge feast,” you know? So you’re happy. But at the same time, there’s Jeff next to a table, covered. So it’s like, “Uh-oh, something ain’t right.”', 'Brad and Tai got brownie points, because… you provided for everybody, in a sense. But that makes me suspicious, because everything in this game is calculated.', 'Once the merge happens, everything takes off like a jet plane. Yeah, we all happy and we’re eating and drinking and last suppering together, but people are having conversations, people are reuniting, everybody is sizing people up, and things are gonna start flying. People’s heads are gonna start rolling. So this is where I step my game up.', 'Michaela wears her heart on her sleeve. I used to be like that. I was-- I literally, when I was Michaela’s age, I was a hothead like Michaela. I thought I knew… (laughs) I thought I knew everything, but I learned when you put that guard up, you push people away, and in a game like Survivor, you want to bring as many people in as possible. You don’t want to be pushing people away or making people feel uncomfortable.', 'Right now, Michaela’s public enemy number one, but I genuinely like Michaela, and as a human, and as a older… person to a younger person, you want to save her, and I if I can do that, that’s one person that I can count on to have my back.', 'I don’t particularly like to vote for Michaela. Is that good for my game? Why would I just go with that plan? Because Sierra says so? Being that there were two options, Michaela or Hali, why not Hali?', 'Here’s the thing, you can’t win the war unless you have a sufficient army. And if Michaela goes home, that’s one less person that I can count on.', 'Everybody is on edge. Everybody is watching everybody. So I need Michaela to vote for Zeke to stick with the plan, so nobody knows Cirie is the one that changed the plan.', 'For me, tonight’s Tribal Council is about saving a person that I can depend on and use for the numbers on our side. And if I pull this off, the future of my game is looking good.', 'At Tribal, I voted for Michaela, and Michaela voted for Zeke to go, which was along with the plan, but I have my own ideas in my own game that I want to play, so this next Tribal Council is going to let the dragon loose. Is-- everything going to be out in the open and the war is gonna start.', 'The way I see Sierra and Brad, Sierra is like the godfather, and she is controlling Brad, who is controlling Troyzan. So it’s like a chain, and if we cut the top link off the chain, it’s just going to shatter. So I think she could be potentially on the chopping block. Zeke is willing. Andrea is down. I trust officer Sarah, and I know Michaela will go along with it. We’re ready for war. (laughs) We are soldiered up.', 'We come back to camp after we lose the Marshalls Reward Challenge. It was up to Sierra and I to win it, and we just could not do it today. You feel like a loser. Like, just… “Can I-- am I going to do anything? Or am I going to be successful at anything?” I had kids young, so I worked really hard to provide. I never wanted to be in a position that my kids needed something and I’m unable to do it for them. But this game, it takes you to the deepest, like, most hurtful places that you’ve ever felt, especially in a loss like today. To not be able to get it for them is like not being able to provide for your family.', 'My family is my motivation, and I plan on winning for them. And I guess that’s where it-it gets emotional for me.', '(tearfully) Although we lost the challenge, if I didn’t try to complete it… (sniffles) I would have felt like a complete failure. I just couldn’t let fear or exhaustion stop me or beat me this time.', 'This is a rough game. We’re all vying for the same prize, but when it comes down to it, the people that are playing are really good people, and… (pauses) it showed in the way that they helped me today. I know that I’m not a challenge beast, so I’ve always just done what was necessary to get me by. I didn’t want to ever push further than that, because I-- it wasn’t really necessary. But doing that, I’ve limited myself in a lot of ways. I’m not letting my mind tell me, “Be afraid. Don’t do it. Just give up,” anymore. I-I can do it. And if I can’t win this game by winning challenges, I’m going to do everything I can to try to solidify my relationships in the game. It’s gonna be what’s necessary for me to win this thing.', 'I had a conversation with Sarah trying to get her to see that she doesn’t want to be on the bottom of Brad and Sierra’s little group. I think deep down she realizes that, but it’s just like me on the balance beam. She knows the best thing for her to do is to cross that beam, but she’s afraid.', 'We took the control from Sierra and Brad tonight, but in Survivor, there’s never any rest at all. You have to be like an evil eye. You have to watch everything, because if you’re not watching, it just takes a second and the wrong move, and the next thing you know, you’re sitting on the jury.', 'It would be easy just for us six to vote Sierra and go along, but Zeke is way more threatening to me than Sierra. He knows this game better than any of us out here. I played four times, and Zeke knows this game better than I do. Now I have to get officer Sarah on board, but officer Sarah’s real touchy about Zeke, so you got to handle officer Sarah very carefully.', 'If the pair of Sierra and Brad stay together long enough and they can convince enough people to come back to that side, we’re back in trouble. So we gotta split that up.', 'Jared is like his mom. He’s not an island boy. He’s a city kid. You know, he’s never been anywhere. It’s huge to see him open to different things. The only thing that would be better than that is for me to make it to the end and win for him.', 'Sarah’s been getting her work in with a lot of people… and fine for me. I like to take her to the end, and all the people she screwed over sit right there and decide who wins.', 'Andrea is trying to work me like I’m a cheap suit, trying to hint around about Sarah, but I need Sarah to stay in order for me to make it further in the game.', 'Everything out here is about timing and when to make a move. So at Tribal Council, should Sarah and I get rid of Andrea and drop our numbers down, or keep our five strong and go for Brad, because Brad is just too dangerous to keep around. He wins challenges. It’s a real difficult position to be in, but timing is key here.', 'We sent Andrea to the jury, but we still have a lot of people in this game that need to go. And although Aubry is in our group, I can’t trust her that much.', 'What was really bizarre when we came back from Tribal, Tai immediately runs right to Aubry’s side. Tai was like Aubry’s husband, and he was consoling her more than anybody else, which was kind of weird to me. Tai works people, and he works on their emotional side. So the way he’s moving around with Aubry lets me know that they’re some kind of pair happening there.', 'Brad is safe, so now we have to recalculate what our next move is going to be, and I’m ready to take out somebody that is a threat to me.', 'Sarah’s so confident in Tai that I can’t even get her to use her own advantage, so she wants to give it to me ‘cause she’s that confident, but do I play it tonight and save Sarah and risk Sarah being pissed off at me? I’m from the old school. If you got it, play it. So I’m going to use it, believe that.', 'The advantage is that you can steal a person’s vote and utilize that for yourself, which gives you basically an extra vote. However, once I do that, whoever we voted for, now after that has the option to play an idol if they have it. And I think probably Tai has an idol. (frustrated sigh) I need to get Tai comfortable enough to trust me. I maybe could tell Tai about the advantage, and I’m willing to use this to save him that they trying to pull a fast one on him, but I don’t know if he would believe that. Damn, could I pull that off?', 'I’m in a lot of trouble right now. Sarah is really pissed and thinks that I’m trying to pull an okey-doke on her. It kind of felt like, “Whoa, you know, I’m trying to do you a favor,” but as the saying goes, “No good deed goes unpunished.” Hopefully there’s something to be saved, salvaged. I-I don’t know.', 'At this point, Sarah, Troyzan, and Brad just came from the reward, and I’m not sure what they discussed. After last night’s Tribal, I’d be surprised if they wasn’t come after me. So I tried to tell Tai we need to pull all our differences aside and come together and get rid of one of those three.', 'The only thing is, Tai knows that everything that happened to him last night was because of me, so I’m sure he doesn’t trust me.']), 'Sarah': (1, [\"I played Survivor: Cagayan, and I have a phenomenal social game.

Why would you throw us under the bus so you could save face?\" Things are starting to look weird now. Zeke doesn\\'t really want to get rid of Ozzy and Zeke threw Andrea and I under the bus. I\\'m like, \"This kind of is starting to stink. Do Zeke and Ozzy have something more going on that I don\\'t know about?\" And that really scares me. This could be a huge mistake, but maybe we need to get rid of Ozzy and keep Varner.', 'You know, I come from a very conservative background. I don’t know any transgender people until now, and the fact that I’ve been with Zeke and gotten to know him as a person from Day 1… I love that guy, and it doesn’t change who he is to me. If anything, it makes us stronger, I feel. So I woke up this morning, and Zeke is Zeke.', 'We lost the Marshalls spa day, and it’s a huge letdown, but I’m finding myself in the middle. I have options. And it’s just going to be which group wants to vote out the person that I want to vote out.

The one group, Brad, Sierra, Troyzan, Tai, Debbie, they want to vote out Ozzy, and then there’s another group of Cirie, Andrea, Michaela, Aubry, and Ozzy, and they want to see Zeke go. I’m weighing out all my options, and to vote Ozzy out, that means taking out a big social and challenge threat right now. That’s the move to make early on in a merge. But then, a lot of people want Zeke out, because he’s a smart guy and he’s willing to make moves, and when you trust somebody like that, you will end up getting blindsided.

Having Zeke opens up options for me.', 'As much as people want to think that the line is drawn in the sand, well, I hate to break it to people, but the tide comes up pretty quickly, and that line gets washed away.', 'I’m looking over at Michaela, and I see a rolled up piece of paper that says “Secret Advantage,” and I can’t believe Michaela didn’t see that.

This vote for our alliance is a huge decision, because right now it’s 6 to 4. We vote out one of our own, it’s 5 to 4. One person flips over, they’ve got the numbers. But at the same time, if I press the issue of keeping Zeke, they’re going to think I have an ulterior motive, they’re not going to trust me, and trust is everything in this game, so I don’t know what I’m going to do, but I have a feeling the deciding vote is going to come down to Michaela and me.', 'Brad and Sierra need to be split up, and when Sierra told me about this advantage, it actually makes me want to keep her now because she’s given me information and she wants to work with me. So the door is opening for her to stay in this game and Brad’s game is over.', 'So originally, I didn’t want to vote Sierra out, but Brad won immunity, and if Sierra goes, it is not all bad, because Sierra has told me about this Legacy Advantage and that she would will it to me if she leaves. Now the only trick is, I need to confirm that Sierra thinks I’m good with her to ensure that she gives it to me. I don’t want to vote her out, but this isn’t about making friends.

I need them to help me vote Sierra out, because I need that advantage.', 'Last night at Tribal, taking out Sierra was good, because she told me about this Legacy Advantage.

Tonight is actually the biggest vote of the game. It’s going to determine who will be in the final four. So Tai and I have to figure out which way to go.', 'Brad and Troyzan have been tight the entire game, so, clearly, they’re going to make a move against me or Tai. So when he said, “Let’s vote for Troyzan, and force a tie,” which would come down to a fire-making challenge, I have to consider it, even though it scares the crap out of me. Brad’s pretty cocky right now and thinks he’s calling the shots. But I’m thinking, “Screw that.” If I can win a fire-making challenge, I can decide who’s going to the final three.', 'Tai’s telling me that he can’t win, but he’s made moves and found three idols. So he has a résumé. However, Tai is so all over the place, he might have alienated the jury. And then there’s Troyzan, who hasn’t done anything without Brad’s permission this whole game. But at the same time, he hasn’t made anyone mad. And Sandra won twice by not making anyone mad.', 'If I do this and win, I could rack up a ton of points with the jury, but I have to decide if this is a risk that I’m willing to take. It’s a coin flip, and I’ve got to pick heads or tails.', 'Knowing that I am in the final three is the best feeling in the world. It’s what you dream of when Jeff says the word “Go!” on Day 1. I worked my butt off to get here. I made moves that other people were scared to make. I made moves that I was scared to make. And I’m very proud of how I played. As a police officer, I don’t respect being lied to. It makes me feel like you think that I’m stupid. But I’m the criminal tonight. And those people on the jury are the police officers.

I’m for sure safe tonight, so why not go for someone that’s been coming for me? And that would be Zeke. Initially we were targeting Sierra. It makes sense, we have six, they have four, why wouldn’t we just pluck one of them off? But my relationship with Zeke has been so out of control. We went from what I thought was BFFs to him totally betraying me, and now I cannot wait to get him out of this game.

      "[\"You know, we're not getting eight hours' sleep. We're not getting... you know, but a handful of food a day. But, you know, this is the game we signed up to play.\", \"It's pasty. It tastes like glue. It just... in your mouth, it goes (smacking lips) It's just horrible, and I can't eat it.\", \"Jerri's gonna take that job over, which I hope doesn't hurt Keith's feelings. You know, I mean, that's his area, and it's kind of a slap in the face.\", 'You know, it was like a big feeding frenzy. You know, \"Kel\\'s got beef jerky,\" and they said, \"Look in his backpack real quick,\" and I was standing right there, and I did it. And there wasn\\'t anything in there at all. But still and yet, all I was thinking about, \"If I find beef jerky in here, it\\'s gonna be ugly.\"', \"I'll definitely feel bad about having to vote somebody off. There's some humiliation involved with being the first one voted off.\", \"To be honest, I didn't expect this adventure to be this hard. I find myself just craving food. Doritos-- I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world.\", \"I can't wait to get the food you don't have to work your butt off so hard to get. I mean, we have done fantastic on a small amount of food. You get food in us, and we're going to be unstoppable.\", \"The fish that Keith made was excellent. That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving. We were so hungry.\", \"Maralyn, she's kind of like our little song bird and our little cheerleader in our camp, so Maralyn and I have bonded more so than I have with any of the other people. It might be our ages, it might be that we just kind of took up for one another.\", 'Tired. That was a rough one. Cold... rainy... pretty miserable.', 'The mood in the camp is a sad mood, but it\\'s also a very strategic mood. Everybody\\'s thinking, \"Who\\'s thinking what?\"', 'I had slept outside last night, as did Keith. We were the first ones up, so we thought, \"First ones up, let\\'s just get up and go fishing this morning.\" So we cleared everything off the boat, got the fishing rods together. Jerri popped up out of the tent, ran, turned over the canoe and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.', 'I just said, \"Look, you know, we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We\\'re going to go fishing.\" And apparently, Keith wanted to have a talk with me, so he said, \"Well, Tina, let\\'s just go walk along the bank and fish that way.\"', \"You have four or five young people playing that they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second nature just to-- woo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider, which I am an outsider at this point.\", 'It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp, even though we know that it has to cross the water in order to get to us.', \"I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel?\", \"There was a little bit of it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was, if I could get Colby, that would be two of us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber, and that would be the only chance that I would have to make it. At this point, I don't have anything to lose.\", \"It's just extremely hazy and smoky, and... it's an interesting morning.\", \"It's not the things you lose, it's just losing. You know, it takes such a psychological hit on your already psychologically tired body, that, for our team, it's definitely the loss that hits us hard.\", \"I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to time out, but to be honest, I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know, you're always walking on eggshells around her, and it's just no fun living in that type of situation.\", \"Everybody here knows the importance of winning today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. That's pressure.\", \"You go to one camp or the other, and I'm not sure how that decision is going to be made at this point. It's important for us to get information right now about who's had votes cast against them, because it's probably going to come down to a tie-breaker vote.\", \"Glad to know it's not one of those things that's life-threatening. I felt a lot of relief.\", \"The importance at this point in at five and five, had a huge impact on the Ogakor tribes. If we had gone in at six and four, we would have been picked off one by one, no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ballgame, we're going into overtime.\", 'I don\\'t think it was a deliberate thing where he said, \"I\\'m going to take my matches with me so the girls won\\'t have it.\" He would not do that under any circumstances. It\\'s in Jerri\\'s best interest not to show a real hateful side.', \"It's nice, starting all over, starting on equal ground. And it was important to listen more than you talk, find out what you're up against.\", 'I looked over at Keith and Keith said, \"Tina, I need this one.\" In his heart he must have really thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him.', \"It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there, because I've been out there ten hours. I knew for our team that we... I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it.\", \"You go into a merger, thinking that you're very much allied with a team, but then, as time goes by, you might find out that there's people that are more deserving, you know? I want this to be on an individual basis, and I want the good guys to win.\", \"Ever since the beginning, the cooking of the rice has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor, and the same problem came with us to Barramundi. Basically, what it is, is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be... perfect, you know, or... you-you catch it.\", 'Poor little Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice, and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth\\'s feelings, because here she is, trying to help the tribe, and then to not be appreciated for it, and to be judged-- that\\'s very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth to say, \"You know what? You\\'ll get my vote.\"', \"The rain settled in here, and it muddied our water, and it's so cloudy that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from shore, and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.\", 'Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the order. We all agree or disagree on things.', \"And if we don't catch our food, we won't be eating any food. Here on out, you know, it's gonna have to be... everybody working together, catching... crickets, grubs, whatever we can find, in order to have people fishing, and that's no easy task on its own.\", 'I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of nutrition-- you know, I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread-- and it\\'s just... it\\'s just going \"rrrr.\" You know, my body\\'s trying to process it, and it\\'s just not going too good.', \"The water has risen considerably from last night, and we're losing ground, and we had our flag on the other side of our tent, and... I had to move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over there. And we're probably going to have to move camp today, actually. Today or tomorrow, no doubt. The water's risen, and it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly encroaching on us.\", \"Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing? No. He was asked to go fishing, but he said that he's never been before, and he wasn't planning on starting now.\", \"Nutritionally, you know, our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really what to do about it. Um, I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning, just making it out of the tent this morning. I'm really concerned about her.\", \"I think it was a fair trade if we can keep the rains away, as long as it's not a torrential downpour. We may get wet, but there's worse things in life than being wet, such as starving to death.\", \"We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps.\", \"That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days, which, to be honest, that's what I thought was going to occur.\", \"Amber's a sweet girl, but you can't get by just on flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own two feet. Now, she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than I made her out to be.\", \"I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was, you know, that's our home. Washed away our food, our cooking, our knives, everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest, I was just really, really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry.\", 'I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross midway and I saw that the current was strong and your adrenaline gets pumping, and-and you just know, I can do anything.', \"We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice can. It's just survival of the fittest. And I want to eat, plain and simple. I-I want the rice.\", \"There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it, you know? In the river bed where it's gonna flood, or up on the high point where we can get struck by lightning?\", \"I miss my husband and my children more than anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half, and my husband is my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them.\", 'Whenever I got on the computer, I could not type fast enough. I said, “We won. Of all the things that I wanted to win, this was it. I wanted to talk to you all so... much.” I got a major rush from getting to talk to my family. And I thought, that\\'s enough to carry me through another eight days, easy. “I love and miss you all more than you will ever know, and I will never ever go away again for this long.” I thought, \"Eight more days? Got it beat, girl.\"', 'After I won my reward, the main emotion was sheer joy.', 'I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another, it was just sheer joy.', \"I'm looking at the river, and it's running through our old camp. That is truly amazing.\", \"Whenever we very first started playing this game, we knew that there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end, it seems that, you know, we can joke around a little bit even, and we can laugh about it, and we can keep our sanity.\", 'We see Colby coming up, and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on, and it was Colby\\'s mom. She gave us all a big hug, and she said, \"This is a hug from home.\"', \"There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. And it seems that the day of Tribal Council, people are whispering and talking, and a little bit of paranoia sets in, too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off. You know, there's only four of you, and one of you's got to go.\", \"On Day 40, being here... becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor and I came here with the idea of winning challenges, of having an adventure, of doing well, I never thought I could get this far. As this game is coming to an end, I think that I have... evolved, that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist, and it worked to get me from 16 to three.\", \"For me, personally, I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so, I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way.\", \"It's been a long, long journey, and everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull, and now, you've only got three days left, and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over.\", \"This last morning, you know, everything seems like the last for the three of us, and it's just... I know it's a game, but still it's sad, you know? It's not just a game coming to an end, but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company.\", \"Every now and then, you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact, and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know, I can already feel the... anxiety of some sort in my chest, and a warm fuzzy, you know, coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be, you know, one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know, my gosh, we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard, but, uh... it's hard to say good-bye.\", \"I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. And I think that, you know, I've been guilty of living my life and, uh, trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and, um... and ver... fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life, the Outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you, and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home, I want to go back and for the first time really nurture my family.\", \"Usually, when we've left Tribal Council, there's been a wide range of emotion, such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off, that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth, and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp, and we were a little happy.\", 'Last night, coming into camp, just me and Colby, I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. I accomplished something that I wanted to do, and that was to make it to last two.', \"This last immunity, I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won, I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him.\", \"I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know, we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote, and we've kept Keith around for that reason.\", \"I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures, capturing those to take 'em home with me.\", \"I look at Colby. He came here for one thing-- to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason, and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open.\", \"I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp, kind of as a tribute.\", 'The shelter-- it was built with no food in our system, very, very weak bodies. That day, building that shelter was very, very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying, \"It was worth it, because look where I am. I\\'m one of the two. It was worth it.\"', \"What it boils down to is did I come here for 42 days to starve, to live in the type of environment that I've lived in, to make those type of sacrifices, to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars? Or did I come here to play this game and me deserve the million dollars?\"]\n"
