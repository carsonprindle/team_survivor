You know I mean that's his area and it's kind of a slap in the face. \", \"You know it was like a big feeding frenzy. You know Kel's got beef jerky and they said Look in his backpack real quick and I was standing right there and I did it. And there wasn't anything in there at all. But still and yet all I was thinking about If I find beef jerky in here it's gonna be ugly. \", \"I'll definitely feel bad about having to vote somebody off. There's some humiliation involved with being the first one voted off. \", \"To be honest I didn't expect this adventure to be this hard. I find myself just craving food. Doritos-- I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world.\", \"I can't wait to get the food you don't have to work your butt off so hard to get. I mean we have done fantastic on a small amount of food. You get food in us and we're going to be unstoppable. \", \"The fish that Keith made was excellent. That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving. We were so hungry. \", \"Maralyn she's kind of like our little song bird and our little cheerleader in our camp so Maralyn and I have bonded more so than I have with any of the other people. It might be our ages it might be that we just kind of took up for one another. \", 'Tired. That was a rough one. Cold rainy pretty miserable. ', \"The mood in the camp is a sad mood but it's also a very strategic mood. Everybody's thinking Who's thinking what. \", \"I had slept outside last night as did Keith. We were the first ones up so we thought First ones up let's just get up and go fishing this morning. So we cleared everything off the boat got the fishing rods together. Jerri popped up out of the tent ran turned over the canoe and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.\", \"I just said Look you know we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We're going to go fishing. And apparently Keith wanted to have a talk with me so he said Well Tina let's just go walk along the bank and fish that way.\", \"You have four or five young people playing that they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second nature just to-- woo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider which I am an outsider at this point.\", 'It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp even though we know that it has to cross the water in order to get to us. ', \"I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel. \", \"There was a little bit of it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was if I could get Colby that would be two of us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber and that would be the only chance that I would have to make it. At this point I don't have anything to lose. \", \"It's just extremely hazy and smoky and it's an interesting morning.\", \"It's not the things you lose it's just losing. You know it takes such a psychological hit on your already psychologically tired body that for our team it's definitely the loss that hits us hard. \", \"I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to time out but to be honest I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know you're always walking on eggshells around her and it's just no fun living in that type of situation. \", \"Everybody here knows the importance of winning today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. That's pressure. \", \"You go to one camp or the other and I'm not sure how that decision is going to be made at this point. It's important for us to get information right now about who's had votes cast against them because it's probably going to come down to a tie-breaker vote.\", \"Glad to know it's not one of those things that's life-threatening. I felt a lot of relief. \", \"The importance at this point in at five and five had a huge impact on the Ogakor tribes. If we had gone in at six and four we would have been picked off one by one no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ballgame we're going into overtime. \", \"I don't think it was a deliberate thing where he said I'm going to take my matches with me so the girls won't have it. He would not do that under any circumstances. It's in Jerri's best interest not to show a real hateful side. \", \"It's nice starting all over starting on equal ground. And it was important to listen more than you talk find out what you're up against. \", 'I looked over at Keith and Keith said Tina I need this one. In his heart he must have really thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him. ', \"It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there because I've been out there ten hours. I knew for our team that we I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it.\", \"You go into a merger thinking that you're very much allied with a team but then as time goes by you might find out that there's people that are more deserving you know. I want this to be on an individual basis and I want the good guys to win.\", \"Ever since the beginning the cooking of the rice has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor and the same problem came with us to Barramundi. Basically what it is is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be perfect you know or you-you catch it. \", \"Poor little Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth's feelings because here she is trying to help the tribe and then to not be appreciated for it and to be judged-- that's very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth to say You know what. You'll get my vote. \", \"The rain settled in here and it muddied our water and it's so cloudy that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from shore and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.\", 'Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the order. We all agree or disagree on things.', \"And if we don't catch our food we won't be eating any food. Here on out you know it's gonna have to be everybody working together catching crickets grubs whatever we can find in order to have people fishing and that's no easy task on its own.\", \"I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of nutrition-- you know I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread-- and it's just it's just going rrrr. You know my body's trying to process it and it's just not going too good. \", \"The water has risen considerably from last night and we're losing ground and we had our flag on the other side of our tent and I had to move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over there. And we're probably going to have to move camp today actually. Today or tomorrow no doubt. The water's risen and it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly encroaching on us. \", \"Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing. No. He was asked to go fishing but he said that he's never been before and he wasn't planning on starting now. \", \"Nutritionally you know our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really what to do about it. Um I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning just making it out of the tent this morning. I'm really concerned about her. \", \"I think it was a fair trade if we can keep the rains away as long as it's not a torrential downpour. We may get wet but there's worse things in life than being wet such as starving to death. \", \"We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps. \", \"That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days which to be honest that's what I thought was going to occur.\", \"Amber's a sweet girl but you can't get by just on flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own two feet. Now she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than I made her out to be.\", \"I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was you know that's our home. Washed away our food our cooking our knives everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest I was just really really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry. \", 'I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross midway and I saw that the current was strong and your adrenaline gets pumping and-and you just know I can do anything. ', \"We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice can. It's just survival of the fittest. And I want to eat plain and simple. I-I want the rice. \", \"There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it you know. In the river bed where it's gonna flood or up on the high point where we can get struck by lightning. \", \"I miss my husband and my children more than anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half and my husband is my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them.\", 'After I won my reward the main emotion was sheer joy. ', 'I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another it was just sheer joy. ', \"I'm looking at the river and it's running through our old camp. That is truly amazing. \", \"Whenever we very first started playing this game we knew that there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end it seems that you know we can joke around a little bit even and we can laugh about it and we can keep our sanity.\", \"We see Colby coming up and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on and it was Colby's mom. She gave us all a big hug and she said This is a hug from home. \", \"There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. And it seems that the day of Tribal Council people are whispering and talking and a little bit of paranoia sets in too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off. You know there's only four of you and one of you's got to go. \", \"On Day 40 being here becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor and I came here with the idea of winning challenges of having an adventure of doing well I never thought I could get this far. As this game is coming to an end I think that I have evolved that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist and it worked to get me from 16 to three.\", \"For me personally I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way.\", \"It's been a long long journey and everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull and now you've only got three days left and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over. \", \"This last morning you know everything seems like the last for the three of us and it's just I know it's a game but still it's sad you know. It's not just a game coming to an end but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company. \", \"Every now and then you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know I can already feel the anxiety of some sort in my chest and a warm fuzzy you know coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be you know one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know my gosh we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard but uh it's hard to say good-bye. \", \"I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. And I think that you know I've been guilty of living my life and uh trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and um and ver fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life the Outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home I want to go back and for the first time really nurture my family. \", \"Usually when we've left Tribal Council there's been a wide range of emotion such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp and we were a little happy. \", 'Last night coming into camp just me and Colby I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. I accomplished something that I wanted to do and that was to make it to last two. ', \"This last immunity I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him. \", \"I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote and we've kept Keith around for that reason. \", \"I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures capturing those to take 'em home with me. \", \"I look at Colby. He came here for one thing-- to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open. \", \"I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp kind of as a tribute. \", \"The shelter-- it was built with no food in our system very very weak bodies. That day building that shelter was very very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying It was worth it because look where I am. I'm one of the two. It was worth it. \", \"What it boils down to is did I come here for 42 days to starve to live in the type of environment that I've lived in to make those type of sacrifices to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars. Or did I come here to play this game and me deserve the million dollars. \"]\n"

You know Kel's got beef jerky and they said Look in his backpack real quick and I was standing right there and I did it. And there wasn't anything in there at all. But still and yet all I was thinking about If I find beef jerky in here it's gonna be ugly. \", \"I'll definitely feel bad about having to vote somebody off. There's some humiliation involved with being the first one voted off. \", \"To be honest I didn't expect this adventure to be this hard. I find myself just craving food. Doritos-- I want a bag of Doritos more than anything in the world.\", \"I can't wait to get the food you don't have to work your butt off so hard to get. I mean we have done fantastic on a small amount of food. You get food in us and we're going to be unstoppable. \", \"The fish that Keith made was excellent. That was like a blessing 'cause we were starving. We were so hungry. \", \"Maralyn she's kind of like our little song bird and our little cheerleader in our camp so Maralyn and I have bonded more so than I have with any of the other people. It might be our ages it might be that we just kind of took up for one another. \", 'Tired. That was a rough one. Cold rainy pretty miserable. ', \"The mood in the camp is a sad mood but it's also a very strategic mood. Everybody's thinking Who's thinking what. \", \"I had slept outside last night as did Keith. We were the first ones up so we thought First ones up let's just get up and go fishing this morning. So we cleared everything off the boat got the fishing rods together. Jerri popped up out of the tent ran turned over the canoe and acted like she was going to get ready to go fishing.\", \"I just said Look you know we were gonna go fishing. You all were asleep. We're going to go fishing. And apparently Keith wanted to have a talk with me so he said Well Tina let's just go walk along the bank and fish that way.\", \"You have four or five young people playing that they've got so much chemistry that it is almost second nature just to-- woo-- just immediately gravitate towards one another. And it makes me feel kind of like an outsider which I am an outsider at this point.\", 'It seems to be getting closer and closer. You can see ash blowing in the wind. We have no idea how close it is to our camp even though we know that it has to cross the water in order to get to us. ', \"I mentioned my frustration with Jerri because it's building. I don't know if it's just me. Do other people feel the same way I feel. \", \"There was a little bit of it just wanting to see how strong does Mitch and Colby align with Jerri. And my thought was if I could get Colby that would be two of us. And then maybe Colby could talk to Amber and that would be the only chance that I would have to make it. At this point I don't have anything to lose. \", \"It's just extremely hazy and smoky and it's an interesting morning.\", \"It's not the things you lose it's just losing. You know it takes such a psychological hit on your already psychologically tired body that for our team it's definitely the loss that hits us hard. \", \"I'm not their mother. It's not my position to get in the middle and send them both to time out but to be honest I think one of the problems needs to go. We can't afford for people not to get along. Jerri makes me feel uncomfortable. You know you're always walking on eggshells around her and it's just no fun living in that type of situation. \", \"Everybody here knows the importance of winning today. Everybody. It is a have-to-win day. That's pressure. \", \"You go to one camp or the other and I'm not sure how that decision is going to be made at this point. It's important for us to get information right now about who's had votes cast against them because it's probably going to come down to a tie-breaker vote.\", \"Glad to know it's not one of those things that's life-threatening. I felt a lot of relief. \", \"The importance at this point in at five and five had a huge impact on the Ogakor tribes. If we had gone in at six and four we would have been picked off one by one no doubt about it. We're starting off the second half of the game on equal ground. It's a tie ballgame we're going into overtime. \", \"I don't think it was a deliberate thing where he said I'm going to take my matches with me so the girls won't have it. He would not do that under any circumstances. It's in Jerri's best interest not to show a real hateful side. \", \"It's nice starting all over starting on equal ground. And it was important to listen more than you talk find out what you're up against. \", 'I looked over at Keith and Keith said Tina I need this one. In his heart he must have really thought that he was going to get the votes cast against him. ', \"It's the hardest thing I've ever done to come in. Much harder to come in than stay out there because I've been out there ten hours. I knew for our team that we I needed to make that decision. So I stepped down and let him have it.\", \"You go into a merger thinking that you're very much allied with a team but then as time goes by you might find out that there's people that are more deserving you know. I want this to be on an individual basis and I want the good guys to win.\", \"Ever since the beginning the cooking of the rice has been a problem. It was a problem at Ogakor and the same problem came with us to Barramundi. Basically what it is is the rice has to be cooked to Jerri's specifications. It has to be stirred a certain number of times. The lid has to stay on. It has to be perfect you know or you-you catch it. \", \"Poor little Elisabeth was sitting there trying to cook the rice and Jerri made some comments about it. It hurt Elisabeth's feelings because here she is trying to help the tribe and then to not be appreciated for it and to be judged-- that's very hurtful. And I think that right there probably was enough for Elisabeth to say You know what. You'll get my vote. \", \"The rain settled in here and it muddied our water and it's so cloudy that fishing has not been good at all. We've lost all but two of our hooks because we have to fish from shore and there's a lot of debris on the bottom.\", 'Me and Colby and Keith usually get together and talk about the order. We all agree or disagree on things.', \"And if we don't catch our food we won't be eating any food. Here on out you know it's gonna have to be everybody working together catching crickets grubs whatever we can find in order to have people fishing and that's no easy task on its own.\", \"I think that our body is so stripped of any kind of nutrition-- you know I had turkey and mashed potatoes and some bread-- and it's just it's just going rrrr. You know my body's trying to process it and it's just not going too good. \", \"The water has risen considerably from last night and we're losing ground and we had our flag on the other side of our tent and I had to move it because we don't know how much longer there's going to be beach over there. And we're probably going to have to move camp today actually. Today or tomorrow no doubt. The water's risen and it must be flooding upstream because it's quickly encroaching on us. \", \"Rodger's been out fishing. Elisabeth's been out fishing. I've been out fishing. Has Nick been out fishing. No. He was asked to go fishing but he said that he's never been before and he wasn't planning on starting now. \", \"Nutritionally you know our body is going into shock. None of us are used to being this weak and not knowing really what to do about it. Um I know Elisabeth is not doing well at all. She had a very hard time getting up this morning just making it out of the tent this morning. I'm really concerned about her. \", \"I think it was a fair trade if we can keep the rains away as long as it's not a torrential downpour. We may get wet but there's worse things in life than being wet such as starving to death. \", \"We're using everything that we possibly can at this point. Every little bit helps. \", \"That rice gave me hope that I was not going to have to be out here starving to death for the next 11 days which to be honest that's what I thought was going to occur.\", \"Amber's a sweet girl but you can't get by just on flying below the radar. She never really proved to me that she could stand on her own two feet. Now she has proved to me that she's a tougher little girl than I made her out to be.\", \"I walked down the hill and I saw the devastation. And my first thought was you know that's our home. Washed away our food our cooking our knives everything. Everything's just gone. And to be honest I was just really really mad. I don't know who I was mad at or what I was mad at. I was just angry. \", 'I went on downriver. I think Keith was trying to cross midway and I saw that the current was strong and your adrenaline gets pumping and-and you just know I can do anything. ', \"We were very hungry. It's the thing that we feel most out here. And there was nothing that would keep me from getting that rice can. It's just survival of the fittest. And I want to eat plain and simple. I-I want the rice. \", \"There's no good place to hide here. It's very frustrating. Where the heck do we build it you know. In the river bed where it's gonna flood or up on the high point where we can get struck by lightning. \", \"I miss my husband and my children more than anything. I'm still kind of a newlywed. I've only been married just a year and a half and my husband is my very best friend. And I miss picking my kids up from school and having my son happy to see me. And I just miss everything about them.\", 'After I won my reward the main emotion was sheer joy. ', 'I mean my mouth hurt from just smiling the whole time I was typing. Just the few words that we got to exchange between one another it was just sheer joy. ', \"I'm looking at the river and it's running through our old camp. That is truly amazing. \", \"Whenever we very first started playing this game we knew that there were some luxuries that we could not afford ourself. One was thinking about family. But now that it's getting towards the end it seems that you know we can joke around a little bit even and we can laugh about it and we can keep our sanity.\", \"We see Colby coming up and along with Colby is this person with a pink sweater on and it was Colby's mom. She gave us all a big hug and she said This is a hug from home. \", \"There is a sense of doom and gloom about Tribal Council. And it seems that the day of Tribal Council people are whispering and talking and a little bit of paranoia sets in too. You don't have as many people to choose from to kick off. You know there's only four of you and one of you's got to go. \", \"On Day 40 being here becomes this overwhelming surprise. I cannot believe that I'm here. Even though I'm a competitor and I came here with the idea of winning challenges of having an adventure of doing well I never thought I could get this far. As this game is coming to an end I think that I have evolved that who I started out as in this game is not who I've ended up as. I have developed more into a strategist and it worked to get me from 16 to three.\", \"For me personally I'm proud of the fact that I'm a woman and I'm here in the final three with two men. And so I wanted my idol to be feminine in her own way.\", \"It's been a long long journey and everything surrounding this game is one big emotional pull and now you've only got three days left and the people that you've shared life with 24-7 for the past 42 days is going to be over. \", \"This last morning you know everything seems like the last for the three of us and it's just I know it's a game but still it's sad you know. It's not just a game coming to an end but it's the game coming to an end and the three of us leaving each other's company. \", \"Every now and then you get a glimpse of closure and you get a glimpse of the impact and you get a glimpse of how significant it is that you've gotten this far. And I can already feel it starting to rise. You know I can already feel the anxiety of some sort in my chest and a warm fuzzy you know coming on. And I don't think this is going to be easy. I think this is going to be you know one of those times of saying good-bye. And I don't know why saying good-bye is so hard. You know my gosh we've been put through the wringer. I don't know why it should be so hard but uh it's hard to say good-bye. \", \"I've got to share the past 42 days with a lot of people who are extremely close to their family. And I think that you know I've been guilty of living my life and uh trying to be this strong individual who didn't really need anybody and um and ver fiercely independent. And I think for the first time in my life the Outback has taught me the value of how much your family means to you and that you really do need each other. And whenever I get home I want to go back and for the first time really nurture my family. \", \"Usually when we've left Tribal Council there's been a wide range of emotion such as Mad Dog. When we voted her off that was a sad day at the Ogakor camp. And there were other times that we came back to camp where it just felt awkward. We really loved Elisabeth and it just felt awkward almost not having her presence there. And there's been some times when we came back from camp and we were a little happy. \", 'Last night coming into camp just me and Colby I have to say that it was sheer exhilaration. I accomplished something that I wanted to do and that was to make it to last two. ', \"This last immunity I was a nervous wreck. Had Keith won I'm not sure whether or not he would have voted for me to stay with him. \", \"I don't think Keith could've made it this far on his own accord. You know we kind of pulled Keith along. We needed a third as part of an alliance to have a majority vote and we've kept Keith around for that reason. \", \"I felt joy. I felt peace. I began to feel closure for the first time. I want to spend the day taking some visual pictures capturing those to take 'em home with me. \", \"I look at Colby. He came here for one thing-- to win a million dollars. He didn't come here to make friends. He didn't come here for any other reason and his actions show that. He speaks it. He lives it. He's wide open. \", \"I think it's important for Colby and I to break down the camp kind of as a tribute. \", \"The shelter-- it was built with no food in our system very very weak bodies. That day building that shelter was very very tough. And to take it down now is almost like saying It was worth it because look where I am. I'm one of the two. It was worth it. \", \"What it boils down to is did I come here for 42 days to starve to live in the type of environment that I've lived in to make those type of sacrifices to give somebody like Elisabeth a million dollars. Or did I come here to play this game and me deserve the million dollars. \"]\n"

But internally I don't think that's the case. \", \"Winning this competition means a lot more to us than just bringing home uh a bag of-of fishing supplies. These are the days when it comes down to morale and the mental edge going into this. And we're three and one now. The stats are pretty good for us. I certainly don't think this answers everything. We still got to catch the fish. The fish aren't going to jump into our camp. \", \"The most tension in the tribe seems to be between Jerri and Keith. With the cooking and everyone responding well to her cooking (whistles) that put them on a level playing field there and so there's not really a power struggle yet but it could definitely come to that point. Even when Keith was over filleting the fish I noticed there were several eyes paying attention and what that tells me is that his stock didn't go up at all. You know all he did was basically play the role of instructor on how to cook fish. \", \"Oh Jerri Jerri and I are getting along great. We've every day we have more fun flirting with each other and seeing how far we can kind of push it. \", \"At this point I'm not sure if Jerri has ulterior motives.

That's not happening with this kid. \", \"Everyone was kind of going in their different directions and I decided just to come upstream and think about the game.

Because if the Kucha members vote for either Jerri or Keith we're going down. \", \"These four are pretty damn determined. I've never seen anything like it. I had no idea it would last this long. There's no telling how long those four are gonna stay out there. Another fun day for Club Barramundi. \", 'When Jerri and Amber came back I made my way down to the beach just to get some grab some time alone and Jerri came up sat down beside me and decided it was time for us to talk.

The floor of the tent was uncomfortable. When the rain started coming in I was on the end. Started getting some water flow in my side of the tent just draining off the tarp that we lay on and then wake up to see the rain like this our fire's out. It's going to be a long day.\", \"Because we're not having the fish we're having to rely on our rice. We're eating a lot more rice than maybe we should be.

Let's just enjoy the day for what  \", \"Jerri was quite giddy on our little getaway. She made a comment to me about it being a honeymoon without the sex and it couldn't be farther from the truth for me. I mean we certainly didn't sit around and high-five and-and say Man we finally get our time alone together you know. That's not what I was looking for. I was just looking for some down time away from the game and that's what I got. It's hard back on Barramundi Beach being out there 26 days going on a month and not have anything but rice so we're just going to go back in and try to be as humble as possible about it. If somebody pisses me off then I'm going to just say I got to go snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef. What did you do today. \", \"Immunity is going to determine who goes next time just like immunity determined who who's going tonight. Nick comes over from Kucha and as Ogakor we're still trying to maintain some sort of control. We determined a long time ago that Nick was more of a threat than say Elisabeth and Rodger. So that determines why Nick goes before them. \", \"You know we're in a spot now but it's not the end of the world. My gosh the human body can go days without food.

And um you can sit around and say What if. you know What if we would've saved. Well we didn't. We don't have any rice. Woulda coulda shoulda you know. If ifs and buts were candy and nuts we'd all have a merry Christmas.\", \"You know what. I had two grasshoppers this morning and a frog. But the big ones you can't even tire those guys out man. They fly forever and are very scarce so you can't sneak up on those. The ones everybody's been fishing with is the little bitty ones which are pretty easy to catch. I haven't seen any lately.\", \"I think Keith Keith probably has the upper hand on the whole uh grasshopper wrangling. Uh a little more experience under his belt. You know he's been at it a while and-and uh he kind of has a handle on it. I've-I've yet to figure out his method um but uh I may have to go to the master so he can teach young grasshopper how to wrangle grasshoppers. \", \"Amber's a little bit nervous about the fact that we voted Jerri off. She felt like she might be the next one that we go after. It could be potentially deadly for all three of us. She and Elisabeth have been bonding quite well.

I want to jump on with you guys. \", \"Rodger and Elisabeth both know that we brought them along this entire time with the intent to eliminate them before we eliminate ourselves. And they are well aware of the fact that they've got to win immunity in order to stick around. \", \"The storm hit about ten minutes into the ride. We went right into the face of the storm and that kind of startled the horses a little bit. Heavy heavy heavy winds. You couldn't see anything around you. It felt like hail the raindrops were coming down so hard. There was so much water running it really looked like there was water running uphill. It was bad stuff. Worse than any storm I've ever been through. I feel sorry for all those guys that had to go back to a very wet Barramundi Beach. \", \"That challenge-and-reward combination was tailor-made for me. To be able to jump on horseback and go ride out to a camp with a bunch of cowboys and sit around a campfire and eat beans and beef stew. I mean that's something I would do at home. \", \"I feel just about as fortunate as I have in 33 days to be able to not only get a warm hot meal but also get a warm dry bed to sleep in. It's a very bittersweet time when you realize what you're doing you know. Virtually what I'm doing by enjoying coffee and enjoying a cot is taking that opportunity away from somebody else. \", 'I was hungry and I dove in and the first plate I had just went straight through me. I felt awful. We were so used to eating nothing but rice out here my stomach just it twisted and turned. As soon as that second or third spoonful went in I knew it was gonna be trouble.

I'm gonna eat as much as I can here and then I'm gonna go sit by the fire and eat as much as I can over there. I may have to stop and use the bathroom four times on the way back to camp and it doesn't matter. Mmm. \", \"I appreciated the opportunity to eat incredibly. Just the opportunity no matter how sick it made me and no matter how sick I feel now. I had that choice-- I had the choice to eat and eat and eat. I'm very fortunate. \", \"I think this is the worst-case scenario that could possibly happen-- returning to camp and having to see what all your tribe mates went through the night before. We tell each other over and over When you win a reward don't feel guilty. But inevitably you you feel guilty. And it wiped everything out you know including a good portion of-of everybody's emotional steam. \", \"Everyone's going through the ringer right now. And out of all six of us I've been the luckiest. This Immunity Challenge is such a double-edged sword for me. I'm worried about saving my own butt but a bigger part of me is worried about winning another challenge and how that's gonna affect the way I'm viewed. \", \"The closer you get to the end the more you think about what's waiting for you when you leave-- be it food be it your family your bed your pillow.\", \"With the storm that came through and the shelter that's the the worst I've seen Tina. She was at a rock bottom. But Elisabeth's been that way for awhile. Physically Elisabeth's run down and emotionally and she's the one we've all tried to nurture a little bit.\", \"Yeah I think it was apparent to everyone here that today at least for a day strategy did not enter in our heads. And that probably won't be the case tomorrow but today we didn't care about winning a million bucks. \", \"From a material standpoint we've lost a lot. I mean we have our rice and now that we know we have food we rationed the rice for the amount of days that we have left. Keith is cooking way too much rice at every meal. All you've got to do is just make smaller servings and-and he just he can't get it through his head. \", \"He's a fool-- the guy's a bozo and I'm just tired of it. I'm tired of dealing with him. And I don't take anything that Keith does for face value. I think there's an ulterior motive to everything he says and everything he does whether it's cooking rice or proposing to his girlfriend online. I don't like the way he's playing the game and I think he's trying way too hard because he can't make it on just being who he is. My game with Keith is done. It's over. \", \"As far as what's wearing on me the most: time. The long days. That's the only thing getting to me nothing else. And if it weren't for the long days Keith wouldn't even get to me. I mean I wouldn't be as volatile as I am if it wasn't for the boredom. \", \"Your fire becomes uh what's been referred to as the Outback television. I mean and that's what it is. That's your entertainment. You look and see how long an ember can burn or how long it takes a log to burn in half to where it collapses. And it's just one of those things. You color in a coloring book or you play a few games of backgammon. Or you get into a conversation with someone that you forgot you had three days ago. \", \"Cold hunger wet-- none of that can compare to the boredom. It doesn't even fit in the same category as far as I'm concerned. \", \"Rodger's always chipped in more than he's had to with the tribe whether it be fishing or boiling water. He's always up to do stuff. Being the oldest guy still here he's got more energy than any of us do you know and I think it comes from his heart. Because we're not playing for ourselves now we're playing for those who are deserving to be here. Rodger and Elisabeth and Tina are all three deserving to be in the final three. As far as Keith goes there's not anything outstanding or phenomenal that he's done that has kept him in the game. Immunity plays a huge part in this because immunity could mean anyone can be along farther in the game. and at this point anybody could win. \", \"The biggest struggle I deal with in the final few Tribal Councils is whether I want to sit beside someone who almost guarantees me the million bucks or whether I want to sit beside someone who if I don't win the million bucks I'll still feel good about that other person winning. I don't even have my answer to that. I did yesterday but it changed this morning and it'll change again um tonight.\", \"I think my mom probably misses me the most just because of-of how close we are. I mean I know she's the one I miss the most and I know she's the one that has gotten me through all this. I mean I talk to her on a daily basis when I get off and spend time by myself. Obviously she doesn't respond orally but I know she's hearing me.\", \"I just won a new car. I cannot believe it. I never had a new car. I won a new damn car. Got one hell of a-a winning streak going and I'm just going to ride it as long as I can.\", \"Keith goes on little sabbatical walks. Keith and I haven't had a whole lot of conversation lately. I think Keith is trying to figure out exactly what his strategy's going to be in the next couple of days and probably also doing a lot of thinking about tomorrow's challenge. I get the feeling that Keith feels like he needs to win tomorrow. \", \"I'm just counting down the minutes and hopefully going to uh get a look at my new ride my new wheels and a hot meal tonight. \", \"The girls surprised me with a little car-warming gift in lieu of a housewarming gift like when you get a new house. A lot of people you deal with in this game are-are disingenuous. They're just It's not real. But with those two girls I really believe it is. \", \"It's awesome. I mean the car is way cooler than I thought it was going to be. And it's got some of the neatest amenities a vehicle's ever had. You know you got a stereo in the back of it not to mention a huge tent. \", \"One thing you don't realize how much you miss until you you're here is the touch and the intimacy of loved ones. Being able to hold somebody and hug 'em-- that's one of the significant uh importances of having my mom here just because she brings some of my daily normalcy back to me. \", \"This morning was awesome. Out of everything that took place in the last 24 hours the hot shower I was looking forward to the least. However now that it's done I think I enjoyed it the most next to-to being able to visit with my mom. I had no idea having a hot shower would feel so good. \", \"Right in the middle of conversation Mom gets up kind of takes off for a second and comes back like Santa Claus with a big burlap sack over her arm and kind of throws it on the rug in front of us and says I can't leave without giving you guys something to go on. And she brought back care packages for Tina and Elisabeth and Keith from their families. \", \"It's almost like a conjugal visit if-if you were a prisoner-- you know having having someone that can come see you but you've got a piece of Plexiglas in between you and that person or something. It was in a way like that 'cause it was bittersweet. I knew she was gonna be here but I also knew she was gonna get taken away. \", \"I'm so lucky that to to have happen what-what has happened over the last day and a half but now it's time to shift gears. Now it's time to go play. We got to go do a challenge and then inevitably go to a Tribal Council night and get rid of one of those three people up there if not myself. How weird is that. \", \"My only loyalty is-is to Tina. There's no other loyalty for me so it could be Keith or Elisabeth I'm gonna vote for. I think both of them need immunity to save themselves at this point. \", \"I still haven't made up my mind as far as who I'm going to vote for. It comes down to two things-- strategy or philanthropy. On one hand you got who deserves it who's a good who's a righteous person who needs that money. Or the other side is use strategy. How can I get that. How can I put that money in my pocket. That's something we've all weighed from Day 1-- how bad do you want the money.\", \"The environment and the elements here have probably been the most dominant player in this game. You've got the 17th player here and it's the environment because it's the one dropping you to your knees kicking you in the butt. And every time you feel like you're getting up you get knocked down again. Either the heat or the lack of food or the-the flooding the rains Something's going to be You know you're going to get a curve ball no matter what.\", \"Whether you want to admit it or not you deteriorate. In 40 days Day 40 is ten times harder than Day 20 was. No question about it. Because you're weaker because you're tired because you're-you're sick of dealing with everything you've had to deal with. And you've still got to play the game. You've still got to think about what's-what's at hand and that's you know surviving the people long enough to get in a position to win.\", \"Trusting people in this game will get you in trouble. And even quicker it'll get you gone and that's-that's because it's a game. And in a way that's where it parallels life but in a way that's where it differs from life for me because the only person I've been truly 100% honest to in this game is myself and in real life I'm not that way. I'm an honest person. But I'm playing to win a million dollars here and so if you trust somebody it's your own fault. You're a fool for not playing the game.\", \"When we first got the Tree Mail and-and reading through it and it said Giving back to the land I was intimidated by that. At first I didn't know how. I didn't know how to approach that whole statement and it took a-a-a lot of time today to remember how much I've taken from the land. We've used it for our shelter. We've used it to stick food in our belly. And at first I didn't get the big picture but when you do stop and think about it for a while and really put your mind to it you realize that you've been given a lot.\", \"While I was working on that totem whether it was painting or carving or-or stringing beads or whatever I was reflecting and think about thinking about what the last 40 days have meant to me. I struggled with it at first trying to figure out what I was supposa while to-to grasp that to think that you know there's not any rules. Just like this game there were no rules. No holds barred play it how you want and see what happens. \", \"I don't want to think about leaving tonight. It's a very real possibility. This whole experience has been full of firsts and lasts every day. But that's just one facet I don't like dwelling on. \", \"I think the three of us are very emotionally attached to each other right now. And if the word love comes out of your mouth then that's the emotion you're feeling at that time you know. I don't love the two of them like I love my family not yet. I haven't known them long enough. But you still share a-a bond that I guess you could call love I mean 'cause you'd have to love some of these people to put up with them in the context that we have for 42 days. \", \"That's what being here for 42 days has done for us-- it's made us realize what we take for granted at home and all those things in our daily living when we're in our comfort zone that we don't appreciate because we're so used to having them. Well we've been out here for 42 days now we appreciate those things back home. Now we appreciate those people that we've taken for granted and the little things they say the way they say our name and all those cool things that you can't wait to get back to. And that's what making these idols was about-- so that we appreciate and remember why we were here. \", \"Returning from Tribal Council was the best feeling I've had in 42 days. It was a victorious feeling. Sixteen of us started and and we were the two that beat 'em all. \", \"I think when it came down to it more than likely he would've kept Tina on board and gotten rid of me so I needed to keep immunity from Keith. That was my only objective last night. \", \"Keith might've been the only way Tina and I could've gotten here. And trust me we tried every way possible to figure out how we could vote Keith off instead of Rodger but sometimes you've got to bring along people that you don't necessarily want to. \", \"I don't think Keith earned the right to sit in a position of-of one of the final two in this game. I don't think he played the game in a fashion or well enough to deserve that spot. \", \"It's a great day. I mean and it is only going to get better each hour that-that goes by and we realize we're one step closer to tonight. I mean it's awesome. Mission accomplished. I mean we've done everything we can. \", \"This is the appropriate place for Tina and I to be. The highest peak that we could see or climb to from our camp. Getting as high as we can and literally feeling like you're on top of the world in more ways than one. \", \"In the game of Survivor you've got to switch hats a lot. You got to wear a white hat part of the time and sometimes you got to put on the black hat and that's the only way you can do good at this game. You got to be the bad guy sometimes. You've got to be a little bit selfish but hopefully in the end you wore a white hat more of the time than you did a black hat. Tina has played the game better than anyone else. She hasn't flown under the radar. However she hasn't ruffled any feathers. She's stayed on course the entire time. I think she knew where she wanted to be and how she was gonna get there much earlier than I did. \", \"Winning this game means so much to me and is so important to me because of the level of difficulty. Because it's been so tough to get to this point. And it has taken so much out of me-- physically emotionally mentally. But that's why it means so much to win this game-- 'cause I have so much invested in it. \"]\n"

So if she wants to cook some uh tortillas for breakfast I think it's fantastic. Actually it's a break for me you know. (chuckles) No no worries mate. \", \"You know it's a bittersweet opportunity. Actually it's a bitter opportunity. There is no sweetness to it. We have to eliminate a person within our group. It could be me. I mean uh it really could be me. For all I know I could be the individual going. \", 'This game is all about deceit deception and how to play using your mind to win.', \"It's going to be physical no matter how you look at it but what we're trying to decide is whether it's a group effort or if it ends up falling on one person and if we have to choose one person well it makes no sense not to choose uh Colby. He's the strongest my God. \", \"When they came back with fish they immediately said Oh where's the chef. The chef word's never been used before. As a chef my strategy was to come in here and create just spectacular dinners and meals and until now we've had zero luck at doing anything from the rivers or from the flora for that matter. \", \"Tonight's dinner was definitely a success. Since cooking the fish I think my stock's gone up uh a good amount. I think the team has uh been pretty excited about what I've been able to do for them. \", \"Oh I think Jerri is uh legitimately attracted to Colby but I'm sure that strategic play comes in is involved there's no question. \", \"I think Jerri's approach is just a lot of she wants to really feel important. She's already got Colby on her side but she gets you know on his side rubbing his back and you know nuzzling at night you know that whole thing sharing the blanket all that kind of stuff. So it's natural for Colby just to gravitate and a little smoke screen goes up and so he doesn't necessarily see certain things. Or maybe he does and I'm just not aware of it. \", \"It was really raining hard. We were not going to let the rain win over our fire. It just wasn't going to happen. \", \"People fight sometimes they put the fire out. We were up all night trying to keep that fire going. I think the hardest thing for me so far has just been trying to uh catch up enough sleep so the body's ready to go into combat in our challenges. \", 'Our last Immunity Challenge was a real tough one. Mad Dog Maralyn you know she had a difficult time. ', \"My vote's not going towards Maralyn.

You know when it comes to the challenges you know he's not Maralyn I think is stronger than he is in the challenges. I could be cutting my own throat doing this but at least with Colby we can discuss it probably disagree upon it and it'll stay with us. \", \"Jerri and the others they wanted to take the canoe out you know. We said Well we're just getting ourselves ready we got all our gear we're getting ready to go. Oh we were going to do that. Well isn't that ironic you know just 'cause we were going to go.\", \"So at Tribal Council last night Tina and I had an opportunity to get a little bit a better understanding of where we sit within our own tribe. When Jerri was asked the question who her friends are she made a point of mentioning Amber Colby Mitchell and herself that they all get along best and then of course she wanted to make sure that everybody was clear that she was here to win the money and she's going to do whatever she has to to win the money. So Tina and I were a little miffed by that.\", \"Jerri is perfect for this game. She will ride the team until it's time to take the knife out and cut someone's throat. I didn't come out here to be pushed around by a bartender- wanna-be-actress. Maybe it's time just to shake her world up a little bit. I can tell you one thing-- Tina and I are not going to go down without a fight. I came here to win the money but now my motive isn't to win the money but to do everything I can to make sure she does not win the money.\", \"Jerri likes to think that she is the leader in some way because Amber and Mitchell she kind of leads them around a little bit. My goal tonight is to try to step in and break all that up. I'll offer my opinion to the team and see what everyone chooses. \", \"Jerri went to go fishing and she needed the can and of course she hollered out to me like her older sibling. I said we'll take them to the end and dump them in the water like we've been doing it and so she brought them down to the water's edge down at the end of camp to dump them out and then she yelled back that it's not a smart idea to dump them in there because \", \"I'm thinking on these couple hundred acres of water I'm not sure that a few fish eating some dead fish is going to matter a whole lot but whatever. \", \"It's not that big of a deal but apparently it was. I don't stand up to her that often 'cause I don't find it necessary 'cause it's more exhausting to argue with her than anything. The fish are now buried.

Jerri has um decided she wants to do fried green tomatoes but they're cherry tomatoes. \", \"You don't do fried green tomatoes with cherry tomatoes.

We really enjoyed that a lot. You know I think as the days go on this game is going to be difficult. It is for me personally exciting. I get caught up in the friendship thing quite easily.

It was a real pain. \", \"You know the honeymoon stage is going to end quickly. We're going to have to go into an Immunity Challenge and it's going to be obvious that we're kind of two teams living as one tribe. \", \"Yeah I think Ogakor was definitely a team that stayed out of vision knowing that we needed to whittle down the Kucha people. Kucha knows what we're doing. They are really good nice people and which does make it harder as the days go on. And the closer you become to uh an individual you start questioning Geez you know I like this person better than somebody I know on my own team.\", 'It just seems natural that certain individuals gravitate to each other and Tina and I have made the decision that we want to be with people we like right at the very end.', \"Mysteriously every time we go to Tribal Council we have a rainstorm. I don't know what that means but you have to think there's something working there-- stronger powers than we're aware of. \", \"The physical work is not it's not light. You got to go get wood. You got to break it down. You got to keep the fire going. And life in the Outback is tough and it's getting tougher. It really is getting tougher for everybody.\", \"Nick's a strong guy although Nick's pretty much had it. He's-he's burned out and he says Listen I'm ready and I'm ready to go.

The mail insinuated that we're standing there on some kind of a log structure I think it's going to be in the water. \", \"I think Amber made a tactical mistake by staying tight with Jerri. But she was visibly stunned last night that that took place too. She didn't see it coming. So she probably felt she lost her her big sister comrade last night and she's kind of a lone lamb out in the midst of the rest of us now. And uh she's a big girl you know. She made that decision early on and that's where she sits now. There's nothing can be done about it.\", \"Look at that. You show me Colby doing that. A cowboy can ride bulls and horses but he can't catch grasshoppers. Oh look at that. Coming out.\", \"Yeah I mean you-you expend a lot of energy to try catching grasshoppers. You chase them down I mean you-you'll run sometimes for 100 yards not 100 yards. You'll-you'll run sometimes for several yards chasing a grasshopper down but uh that grasshopper could mean a you know you know a 15-inch black bream so it's very important. \", 'Excuse me. I just caught a grasshopper. Kind of important. Oh no.

And we had a little food this morning but not enough to climb a hill and build a shelter up in the hills that's for sure. \", \"That water came through like a flurry and just took everything with it. It was just There was no way to describe it. Especially when we're out here with so little We lost everything. \", 'So I just walked the riverbank and realized that on the other side our tin of food was there. It was still sealed.

I mean you have no real good reason for picking to vote somebody off other than you're trying to get to the end. \", \"It rained a lot last night and our new shelter leaked. I didn't sleep all night. Everyone was a little little drained this morning.\", \"Rodger and I are usually up right around the first time you know before anybody. We had a bad night of rain so any time we have rain we more than likely lose our fire. Starting fire in the morning is really very very difficult. We were out just doing our morning bathroom break and I looked off to the horizon. I said What is that smoke over there. We found an actual piece of tree that was smoldering from a forest fire that was probably two weeks old. God's giving us a present this morning on this cold wet morning. That was a huge find for us. It was the basis behind a great fire. \", \"This is where the game is really on right now. My intention is that I'll be here with Colby and Tina in the last three. At this stage of the game it's natural that political campaigning is going on especially with these last few individuals because they're your jury. I'm doing a lot more of the cooking now. Now that it's more one-on-one dynamic it's important to be able to do things that the other members of the group see as a value. \", \"The rice issue today was the first time I've seen Colby blow up and uh it got me legitimately concerned especially when Elisabeth was right there chiming in. I  \", 'Not unusual to sit and look at the fire for an hour and just stare at the fire and the flames.

I mean I could be voted off tonight and totally blindsided. \", \"If my legs hold out I'm going to go up to the top of this ridge. You can see 360 degrees over the whole plate land of the Outback here. It's a magnificent view but it's a long walk. \", \"We all find ourselves doing more of a going off and being by yourself time uh and thinking. I think what I spent so much time thinking about is my family my children my parents and of course my fiancé. And I know that I-I see the light at the end of the tunnel now. It's-it's real close now. You don't have a lot of control at this stage of the game. The cards have been dealt and fate is inevitable so it makes the most sense just to kind of glide in be cool and calm enjoy these last few days the best you can. \", \"Still had a moment. I mean me looking at the pictures of my kids and reading letters from my girlfriend and stuff It was It hits you know It's hard not to hold back. I mean we only have a few days left but it's hard. \", \"Not a whole lot I can do right now. You go in and do the best you can on these immunities.

There's only three of us left and uh we have three days. This is what the 42 days is all about. It's about these last three days. I mean everything else becomes just a product to get to this point.\", 'When we had a chance to work on the idols it was an all-day process so you had a lot of reflection time. You thought about uh crossing the river for the first time. You thought about eating your first fish loved ones back home. It was a healing process actually. It helped put closure to everything.', 'Tonight is the last night for one of us to be sleeping here. Tonight is the last night for somebody. ', \"We have an Immunity Challenge coming up-- the most important Immunity Challenge that any of us any of us will play. The winner basically gets to walk up and cast a vote. At this stage of the game we all feel vulnerable because at that stage it's not a voting bloc. It's who you want to be in the finals with. Who do you want the jury to look at sitting next to you to potentially choose you over them to give you the money. That's what it's about now. Tough call. \", \"The last 24 hours has kind of been a little bittersweet. One of us is leaving tonight. One of us saw the sunset for the last time and the sunrise this morning for the last time. One of us had the last meal with us together so it was It's kind of uh you know it's it's strange it's bittersweet it's sad. \", \"The Tree Mail gave instructions on where we should go with the totem that we created and we're going to walk past the torches of all the Survivors that went before us.

That we'd walk past individuals that left before us. One of us will be leaving tonight and there'll be two left so I-I'm actually I'm looking forward to it. I guess it's kind of a saying good-bye process. \", \"The time that I've spent here has been a cleansing process. And I am 40 years old I got two wonderful kids and have had-- like any other individual that's 40 years old-- have had failures and successes and highs and lows. In the last five days I've realized this really is not about the money and it shouldn't be. You should walk away from this with something that's far more valuable than money and I will. I don't think that I have the opportunity to win the money. I don't think I'll be at that level. I mean I'm close but I don't think I'll be of the last two and it's totally fine with me.

If we're if Rodger and I are out there you know blowing all of our energy on fishing and Nick is conserving his energy wisely he's gonna keep winning Immunity Challenges and that's gonna leave a vote to one-one of us one you know either Rodger or myself and that's scary.

It's not the Reward Challenge. Those are hard in themselves. Like they'd be hard anywhere. Living here day-to-day-- those are the real challenges. My hair has been falling out in a lot of clumps. I don't know if I can get one right now but it just keeps Yeah like just falls out all the time. It's malnutrition.\", \"Everyone was really shocked. There are 20-something pounds lost by Colby almost 30 pounds lost by Keith. Tina's at 99; She's not even in triple digits. And I'm not too far away from that. I'm just feeling as though my stomach is eating itself. \", \"Knowing that that was the last Reward Challenge and I couldn't pull one out was kind of sad.

So I'm just feeling kind of drained and lazy right now so I'm sleeping in.\", \"Ironically enough I ended up being Colby's partner anyway. I think it's important that people are constantly reminded of the reality of our situation. There is nothing fair about this. And you know it's about winning.\", \"There's got to be a little little bit of animosity and jealousy from everyone else for winning two rewards in a row. It bothers me a little bit 'cause I can see where that might affect people's voting.

This is It couldn't possibly get any better. \", \"We get under this tent and there is just this spread. There's a basket full of all different kinds of fruits wrapped sandwiches a bag of Doritos There's pasta salad and sweet potatoes and all these different vegetables. \", 'We just we feasted for a good while and then realized: I wonder how everybody else is doing. But I knew. ', 'Here we are in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef. It was just too close to paradise. The setting-- it was it was very very romantic on top of everything else.

We're getting to know each other outside of the game and outside of that environment. This is basically the perfect honeymoon without the sex. \", \"Returning to Barramundi right now is I'm not really looking forward to it. But I at least am going back feeling rejuvenated and renewed and a little bit more like my true self because man after 26 days of putting on the game face and being this tough you know don't-mess-with-me chick I got a tender side too. I feel like a little bit of that was touched today. \", \"Colby's little um shell maneuver was most definitely strategy. For me in a perfect world it would be me and him sitting up there in front of the jury. I find him and myself to be the most even on the playing field more than anybody else here.
